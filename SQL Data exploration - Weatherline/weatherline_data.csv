From a low-level vantage point this morning he could clearly see that Helvellyn had not gathered any more snow overnight, and that what fell yesterday had melted, although there was some frosty ground on the headwall below the OS trig pillar. Walkers should remember that despite the warmth in the valleys, lambs in the fields, and spring flowers blooming everywhere, it can still be very wintry on the tops. Wind chill is also a factor to bear in mind, and temperatures on the fells right now certainly feel well below zero - the assessor recorded -7C with wind chill on St Sunday Crag a couple of days ago. Full waterproofs are always necessary, regardless of the season, and warmth layers are also essential. Throughout this winter season the Assessor team have had to remind people over and over again that a map and compass are absolutely essential for hillwalking. A GPS can certainly be useful, but it can also be very inaccurate, and actually dangerous if used incorrectly. The Fell Top Assessor team of Graham and Jon would like to wish you all a fabulous and safe hillwalking season, until they return at the beginning of December for the next winter season."

The reason why we have finished the Fell Top Assessing season earlier than originally planned is due to the fact that there is no snow to report on as the Lake District Fells are now free from both snow and ice. Despite this, though, the summit windchill was well below freezing today at minus 8 degrees, so those walkers who had elected to ascend in shorts did not linger long! Therefore full waterproofs (which also double as windproofs) and extra layers remain essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells as are a map and compass together with the ability to use them in low cloud – which enveloped the high fells at times today. The Fell Top Assessing team of Jon and Graham would like to thank all of our regular followers for staying with us yet again this winter, and also welcome our new followers who have made use of our #summitsafely campaign. We wish you all a safe and thoroughly enjoyable spring and summer season's hillwalking in Lakeland and look forward to meeting some of you whilst out exploring our wonderful fells.

All walking routes to the summit can be done without crossing snow, and the continuing thaw overnight coupled with heavy rain over the last few days has removed most of the snow from the mountain. On Swirral Edge and Striding Edge the banks of snow that have been present (but dwindling) on the exits have now gone, and the only snow the assessor saw on these ridges today was very small, easily avoidable, patches on the north side of each ridge. Even the snow at the head of Brown Cove, which is usually the last remaining snow in England each year, is just a tiny patch at present, no more than 5 feet wide by 2 feet high, and less than 20cm in depth! The only hazards today for anyone out fellwalking was the wet rock, and the poor visibility. As the Fell Top Assessor service is scheduled to continue until Easter each year, it would have been a very late end to the season for the two assessors this year. As we now have snow-free routes to all summits in Lakeland we have taken the decision as a team to end our assessing today (March 31st) with immediate effect for this winter. Should we see any return to wintry conditions this season, we will of course resume our reports, but otherwise this will be the final Fell Top Assessor ground conditions report of the 2016/17 winter. It has been an odd winter, not just in the Lakes, but also in Wales and Scotland, with snow coming only sporadically, each time followed by massive thaws that has pretty much striped the hills of snow. This winter has also been a mild one, with very few days of frost, so winter climbing has been very poor too. The Fell Top Assessor team of Jon and Graham would like to thank all of our regular followers for staying with us yet again this winter, and also all of our new followers who have made use of our #summitsafely campaign. We wish you all a great spring and summer season's hillwalking in Lakeland, and look forward to seeing you all out there exploring the fells during the rest of the year.

That said, the snow that does remain above 700m is still fairly deep in places, up to 40cm where the assessor was able to take a measurement. As the day was characterised by very thick hillfog reducing visibility to around 10m at times, it was impossible to make a proper assessment of all the remaining snow however. On the Helvellyn edges, both Striding Edge and Swirral Edge have some patches of snow, and the exits of both onto the summit plateau are still snow-bound, albeit to a much lesser degree than of late. The snow that does still block the exits from these ridges was today wet in places but with a harder, icier layer beneath, so care is needed. Should the thaw continue, these banks of snow will probably disappear very soon though. As mentioned above, the main issue today was a navigational challenge. In the very poor visibility it was alarming to come across two groups of people who didn't know where they were and didn't have a map or compass. One couple were relying on Google Maps, which lacks any details of the mountains, and the other small group were armed only with a Wainwright guidebook and weren't sure which page they were on! Relying on finding another walker to ask directions worked for these people today, but they got away with it through pure luck. A map and compass is essential for anyone heading out walking. Full waterproofs and warmth layers are also needed if you want to enjoy your mountain experience at present, as heavy rain featured quite a lot in the day. An ice axe will make crossing any banks of snow a safer option too."

That said, there are significant patches of snow remaining above 750m, and it varies enormously in terms of consolidation and depth. Where the snowpack has been undisturbed by the passage of boots, today it was soft, very wet and still relatively deep in sheltered hollows and where it has drifted. On Paths, where the snow has been compacted, however, there are patches of harder snow and ice making conditions more treacherous, especially where the ground is steep. Today on the Brown Cove Crags route, on the “easy” way up Helvellyn from Swirls, there was still an area of unavoidable hard snow on a convex slope that is difficult to cross safely without an ice axe. Today Swirral and Striding Edges were almost free of snow on their exits, but on both ridges the snow that does remain was hard and icy in places. An ice axe is essential on both ridges for this reason. The main challenge today was navigation in the very poor visibility. With a cloud base varying between 200m and 500m, and with very heavy rain at times, visibility was often reduced to around 20m. Good map and compass skills are essential for finding the way in such conditions. Given the windchill was well below zero today, combined with the heavy rain, full waterproofs and lots of warmth layers were needed in order to remain cheerful. A hat and gloves are essential, and plenty of food and a hot drink should also be taken. An ice axe will be found useful by anyone crossing banks of steep, icy snow."

Although there is a proliferation of shorts and tee shirts in the valleys, the summit conditions are not so conducive to such apparel as the windchill was around zero degrees. Consequentially, full waterproofs (doubling as windproofs), extra layers, mountain boots and equipment remain essential for those venturing out onto the fells. Although the majority of the snowpack was soft, wet and thawing today (and probably will be again on Wednesday with the current forecasted rain), it would only take a slight drop in temperature for the existing snow to harden and slush to re-freeze, so walkers out on the highest fells on Wednesday (especially any early risers) should be prepared and equipped to encounter hard snow and ice."

There is still snow down to around 200m, although only in small patches here and there at that level. Above 500m the snow gets deeper and is more evenly spread, although it has slumped and consolidated somewhat since yesterday. This has left a depth of snow at around 3cm above 500m, and up to 40cm above that height, although there are a few drifts that will be deeper than this. With the consolidation the snow has become safer, although there are still banks of unstable snow on all aspects, but chiefly on those facing NW through to E. The exits from Striding and Swirral Edges are steep banks of snow requiring care, skill, and an ice axe and crampons. With a freezing level at around 800m today paths were icy down to about 650m where the snow has become compressed, but not until you got to 800m did the ground generally turn to ice, even off the paths. On the Brown Cove Crags route there is a steep bank of snow at around 800m that can't be avoided. In ascent it is pretty obvious, but as it is a convex slope it is hard to judge from above when descending, and an ice axe and crampons are needed here. The assessor didn't traverse the Wythburn path around Nethermost Pike today, but suspects that the slopes there will be very similar.

The fresh snow is overlying graupel, which lies on top of icy ground, so a careful approach is needed, especially if temperatures rise slightly.

Rocks on the ridges were ice-coated, as was the summit plateau in places were it had been scoured by the wind. However, as the winds were light during the morning, much of the plateau was becoming snow covered. Due to very low cloud and falling snow visibility was very poor throughout, with blizzard conditions for extended periods of time.

The becks were very, very full today, making crossing them at any point without a bridge a real hazard. The rain throughout the morning didn't cease, and was heavy at all levels. During the late afternoon it eased up a bit, and some areas saw brighter weather coming in at dusk. As the Assessor was running a navigation course for the Lake District Weatherline service on Whiteside today it was impossible to assess the snow conditions on Helvellyn, and he didn't get a view of the higher fell at all during the day. Given the extremely mild temperatures on the hills today it seems unlikely that the short banks of snow on Striding Edge or Swirral Edge that have been there during the last few days will still be remaining, but walkers should assess this themselves if making an ascent of these ridges. Full winter clothing is needed to stay comfortable and cheerful on the fells at present. A map and compass should be carried - they should not be seen as 'nice to have' but rather as absolute essentials."

Yesterday's wet snow has thawed, and the remaining snow on the hills can only be found above 850m in small patches on N through to E facing slopes. The Assessor today took his readings from the summit of Raise, but in the occasional clearing of the cloud base he was able to see that on Swirral Edge the bank of snow that has persisted on the final few metres below the top is still in place. Today it would have been wet and soft. The cloud base varied throughout the day between 300m and 900m, as waves of heavier rain came through at intervals. This gave good visibility at times, but at others the visibility was reduced to around 50m. This gives a navigation challenge for anyone heading onto the fells, which can be a great excuse for practicing those skills if you're a little rusty! Today the Assessor was joined by David and Ruth for a navigation course, and the conditions were perfect for that! The becks and ghylls are currently high with all the rain and snow melt, so take special care when crossing any where bridges don't exist. Anyone heading into the fells will currently need good waterproofs - jacket and trousers, and lots of warmth layers. A map and compass and the skill to use them are also essential.

On the Edges of Helvellyn there was wet snow to a depth of just 1cm on rocks above 800m, but at the exit of Swirral Edge, on the final 5 or 6 metres below the summit plateau, the snow had gathered to a depth of around 70cm, with 25cm of fresh snow overlying the old, harder snow beneath. On the Helvellyn summit plateau ice was forming, but today it was wet - however, a tiny drop in temperature would have turned this to hard water ice requiring crampons. With a cloud base around 600m for much of the morning, navigation was a challenge above that height. Strong winds were also a feature of the day, and it was noticeable that the wind speeds on the Edges and at the cairn on the top of Swirral Edge were much greater (around 60mph) than those recorded on the actual summit. During the descent of Swirral Edge today small rocks were being blown around on the wind coming out of Brown Cove - those gusts must have been in excess of 80mph. Full winter clothing, including good waterproofs and warmth layers are essential. Today the assessor (and Lindsay - one of our #summitsafely prize winners, who won a day out with a Fell Top Assessor) needed an ice axe to make a safe ascent and descent along Swirral Edge.

This was not settling during the morning, but as the afternoon at valley level was wetter than in the morning this could all have changed by the time the assessor gets back up there again tomorrow. Today full winter clothing including good waterproofs were essential to be comfortable on the fells, and these kept the wind out too. Warmth layers are also needed, including spares. Another feature of today's ascent was the poor visibility above 550m - here only a map and compass and navigation skills were up to the job.

Although the bank of snow on Swirral Edge is only on the last few metres, a slip here would have very serious consequences, and as such we recommend that you take an ice axe to help you cut steps, as well as to halt a slide should one occur. There are still unstable cornices on N through to E facing slopes, and although these are not very large, it is wise not to walk on them, or indeed find yourself beneath them, as a collapse sooner or later is inevitable.

Warmth layers, hats and gloves, and waterproofs (which make superb windproofs too!) will enable fell walkers to linger on the summits, and thereby enjoy the superb views.

The exits to Striding Edge and Swirral Edge are both currently steep banks of unstable snow, with cornices very close to the exits on both ridges. Extreme care is needed here, especially in reduced visibility as the 'safe' route down either ridge is a very narrow passage between dangerously corniced ground, and in poor visibility you simply can't see where the dangerous ground lies. On the ridges themselves there is a good depth of fresh snow, and both ridges are very much in full winter condition. Other walking routes on Helvellyn are also under a lot of snow. There is a steep bank of snow on the Brown Cove Crags route from Swirls which can't be avoided, and it is not easy to judge this slope sensibly when approaching from above. On the Wythburn Chapel route there is a very steep slope of snow across which the path cuts as it takes you around the flanks of Nethermost Pike. Again, this can't easily be avoided. Some of the older snow is now starting to consolidate, but further layering of fresh snow on top is making for unstable snow on most aspects. Anyone heading for the heights now should have full winter clothing, including spare warmth layers and full waterproofs. The ability to judge the safety or otherwise of the snowpack is essential right now, as is the ability to choose a good route in the current conditions, and navigate around it accurately with a map and compass.

Overnight rain has filled the becks, and brought a light dusting of snow to the higher ground in the Central and Eastern Fells. This fresh snow was laying above 700m, and was nowhere deeper than 1cm - just a smattering during the morning. There was also a little frozen ground in places above 800m, on rocks on both Striding and Swirral Edges, but this was not sufficient to hinder safe ascents or descents. During the late morning further heavy rain brought more snow above 600m, as the storm force winds picked up. This is likely to continue throughout the rest of the day, so it will be interesting to see the extent of the fresh snow when the Assessor goes up tomorrow. With wind speeds picking up through the morning, it was with some relief that the Assessor today reached his car before lunch. Certainly the speeds recorded on the descent were far greater (in excess of 65mph) than were recorded on the summit just an hour earlier. Anyone heading into the fells should bear in mind that we are now in the grips of mid-winter, despite the changeable conditions we've had so far this season. Full waterproofs, clothing and equipment are essential for anyone going walking, and an ice axe and crampons should be carried by anyone heading above the snowline."

Striding Edge and Swirral Edge can both currently be ascended without recourse to crossing snow. The forecasted snow above 600m hadn't arrived by the time the Assessor was on Helvellyn. However, as Storm Doris comes through during the night and into tomorrow, the current forecast is for snow above 200m, and summit temperatures around minus 3. This coupled with the storm force winds we are expecting will make any walking in the high fells very arduous tomorrow, and will give an exceptionally low windchill, probably somewhere in the region of minus 15C Anyone venturing onto the high fells tomorrow should first consider if this is a good idea. Anyone determined to go high will need full waterproofs, good warmth layers including lots of spares, hats and gloves, winter boots, plenty of food, a headtorch with spare batteries, and a map and compass. The ability to navigate in appalling conditions may well be necessary. There is also a good chance that ground will be frozen, so crampons should be carried as a precaution, and an ice axe will help to keep you safe if ascending, descending or traversing snowy slopes."

While the Assessor felt that there is a possibility that there may be some small pockets of old, wet snow clinging on on the headwall above Scales Tarn, he didn't see any snow at all today. The main challenge on Blencathra's ridges today was the very slippery rock. The rock here is slate, and it is unpleasant in wet conditions.

Full winter clothing, footwear and equipment are essential for those venturing out onto the fells. For those going above the snowline and attempting, or traversing, steep slopes an ice axe and crampons are also essential as are snow goggles. Several people were intending to go above the snowline without such equipment today, but were sensibly amending their routes or turning back. There is currently a huge difference in conditions between the green valleys and alpine-like hills and this looks likely to be the case for the next few days."

Above 650m the snow depth rises with height although, as ever, the actual depth varies from little on windswept areas to reported drifts of 50cm – although such depth is definitely the exception and, indeed, the assessor did not personally encounter any such drifts today - although a depth of between 5 and 10cm was fairly common at 900m. The consistency of the snow varies from soft to hard neve. Popular routes are also covered with compacted snow and ice. Exposed routes above the snowline, such as Striding and Swirral Edges, are now in winter condition and should only be attempted by those experienced in, and equipped for, winter mountaineering. Much of Striding Edge consisted of soft snow and could lull people into believing that no equipment is required to negotiate it; however, there was harder snow and verglas (ice) on rocks on the steep exit necessitating the use of ice axe and crampons. There is the possibility of fresh snow falling overnight, so walkers out on Saturday should be prepared to encounter different conditions from those experienced and described above; this is especially relevant if fresh snow falls on top of older, harder snow with the different layers not bonding. Full winter clothing, footwear and equipment are essential for those venturing out onto the fells. For those going above the snowline and attempting, or traversing, steep slopes an ice axe and crampons are also essential. The summit views today were magnificent, so come properly equipped and enjoy them – including spare layers to cope with the minus 16 degrees windchill experienced today.

Paths on Helvellyn were icy in places from the valleys upwards, and were coated with more ice above 550m. There has been a little further snow on the high fells, and this has gathered in leeward hollows and in leeward gullies (NW through to E faces), occasionally to a depth of 60cm, but more generally between 5cm - 10cm in depth. Where this fresh snow is overlying older, harder snow, the fresh snow is very unstable, cracking and peeling away from the snow beneath. Further accumulations on these slopes could be very dangerous, so walkers and climbers should make their own judgements about how safe, or otherwise, snow slopes are, according to just how much more snow falls throughout the afternoon and overnight. The morning on Helvellyn was dry, and with the cloud base above the summits the views were spectacular. However, it was a very cold day, and lots of warmth layers were essential. Climbers: Ribbons of older snow have now formed into superb neve, giving bullet hard climbing in these areas. However, most of these runnels of neve are very narrow, and some snow in many gullies is broken. Ice is forming on the buttresses, but winter climbing is not yet 'on'!

However, it is wise to treat all fresh snow accumulations with caution, especially as the current forecast is for further snowfall over the next few days. This fresh snow overlying the semi-consolidated stuff could be very unstable. All paths to Helvellyn summit now have snow - the Assessor today found a large, unavoidable bank of steep snow on the 'tourist route' up from Swirls via the top of Brown Cove Crags. This, though not 'technical' required an ice axe and crampons to make a safe ascent and descent. The exits to Striding Edge and Swirral Edge are both steep banks of hardening snow. Climbers: The gullies are gathering some snow, and this can be seen in thin ribbons on a few routes now. The snow is improving, but today the turf beneath was not frozen.

A close look at the gullies on Brown Cove Crags revealed some ice beginning to form, but the turf at surface level is not yet fully frozen. There is currently insufficient snow filling these gullies either, so nothing is yet climbable - but hopefully it won't take long now! Plumes of wind-blasted snow on the east side of Raise means some snow is starting to build up there for skiers, although it will be a bit thin at present.

Since it was plus 4 degrees and foggy on the summit, these insignificant patches of snow were also thawing. As has been the situation on several days recently, the main issue today was the lack of visibility – reiterating the need for good navigational skills and the necessity of carrying a map and compass. Blindly following an apparently obvious path in fog can lead to a false sense of security as the route can often become vague when, for example, traversing rocky areas or on summit plateaus. With limited hours of daylight, always knowing your location enables progress to be monitored – I was asked on several occasions today “How far to go?” With the ground being wet, walkers at altitude should be prepared to encounter ice on grounds and rocks should summit temperatures fall slightly (although not forecast at the time of writing). Anyone contemplating exposed routes at altitude – such as Striding and Swirral Edges – should bear this in mind. Despite the mild valley temperatures, the summit windchill remains below zero, so full winter clothing, footwear and equipment are essential for those venturing out onto the fells. Carrying extra layers is not just for safety but also allows a snack on the summit to be consumed in comfort!"

From 600m this ice is now covering the paths, but can be avoided with care. Above 600m there was a very persistent hill fog layer, reducing visibility above that altitude to around 20m. This made navigation tricky at times, and there were lots of folk out enjoying the higher fells today who were relying purely on following other people down as a means to navigation - a map and compass and the skills to use them are a much safer bet than hoping to find someone who knows where they are going and is happy for you to tag along! There is now very little in the way of snow on the high fells, with just a touch of hail above 900m. This can be seen on the eastern fringes of the Helvellyn summit plateau, especially at the exits from Striding and Swirral Edges, but the snow can be avoided with care. More dangerous at the moment is the verglas that persists on bare rock above 650m - this 'black ice' is hard to spot and makes traversing exposed rocky ridges potentially dangerous. Today the verglas was only in a few places, and could be avoided, but care is certainly needed. Anyone heading onto the fells at present should have full waterproofs, including overtrousers, lots of warmth layers, including hats and gloves, a map and compass, sturdy walking boots, head torch and spare batteries, and plenty of food and drink for the day. Although an ice axe and crampons weren't needed today, it is a very fine line between enjoying dry rock underfoot and finding those rocks plastered with hoar frost and snow."

The only snow of any significance on walking routes on Helvellyn is on the east facing headwalls above 900m, including the very top of Striding Edge and Swirral Edge where a short bank of very hard snow lies. These banks of snow can just about be avoided with care. For skiers and winter climbers there is still nothing to report, as the dry weather continues. While turf is semi frozen above 750m, there is a distinct lack of snow. Throughout the day the cloud base was largely above the summits, with a few banks of fog lifting out of the valleys early morning, and occasionally rolling over the high tops throughout the day.

Today the temperatures have dropped noticeable from yesterday, bringing small amounts of hail down to 400m, and ice on paths above 600m. This currently is easily avoidable, not requiring crampons, but with colder temperatures throughout the remainder of the day and night this will almost certainly change by tomorrow. The rocks on exposed ridges, such as Striding and Swirral Edges, are largely dry and free of snow or ice, although today on both of these ridges there were one or two places were verglas was evident. At the top of both ridges there is a short band of very hard snow, which is difficult to avoid, and an ice axe here was useful for cutting steps today, and to safeguard a slip. The summit plateau on Helvellyn was devoid of snow, but there was some ice forming on rocks and in damp hollows. With windchill at nearly minus 12 degress today, full winter clothing and equipment were essential. This included trousers - the group wearing shorts today were visibly very, very cold indeed, despite trying to look like they do this sort of thing all the time. Remember, waterproofs are also windproof, so jacket AND trousers are essential. You will also need winter walking boots, snow goggles, map and compass, head torch and spare batteries, and plenty of food if going high. An ice axe and crampons are a sensible precaution too - better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them!

Aside from these insignificant patches, the Lakeland fells are currently free from snow. As it was plus 5 degrees and raining on the summit, even this remaining snow was thawing. The main issues today were the lack of visibility – emphasising the need for good navigational skills and the strength of the wind which is also forecast to affect those out on the fells tomorrow. The wind today was very gusty, varying from 18mph to over 40mph on the summit plateau in as many seconds. On Boxing Day, the summit temperature could return to sub zero so, with the ground being very wet, walkers at altitude should expect to encounter a combination of icy ground and strong winds creating challenging conditions.

Striding Edge and Swirral Edge both have a band of snow right at the top where they abut onto the summit plateau, and an ice axe here could certainly help to halt a long slip from these popular scrambles. There was some ice on paths above 750m, but this was only in a few places and easily avoidable. In the morning the cloud base was just above the high summits, but by midday it had fallen to around 750m, and lower in snow and hail showers. Fresh snow fell in flurries throughout the early afternoon, causing occasional blizzard conditions on the high tops with near whiteout at times, albeit for brief periods only.

Today Storm Barbara was the most obvious weather feature, bringing heavy rain on storm force winds. The assessor gave up his attempt on Helvellyn today, having reached Red Tarn via a combination of walking, crawling, and occasionally being blown backwards down the hill. On such a day the wisest choice is to turn back, and that is what he did. From Red Tarn visibility was variable, ranging from occasional glimpses of Catstycam to just a few metres in rain and sleety squalls. It was not possible to see if any snow remains on the higher reaches of Helvellyn, but it did not look like the lower parts of Striding Edge or Swirral Edge currently have any snow remaining, nor did Catstycam. With the milder temperatures, it could be that the little bit of snow higher on the mountain is beginning to consolidate, or it could be that the snow has thawed completely. Hopefully tomorrow will bring better weather, allowing the assessor to make a proper assessment prior to the Christmas period. Anyone venturing onto the fells at present will need a good set of waterproofs - the assessor returned to his car soaked to the skin today - as well as lots of warmth layers, and good map and compass skills. Carry an ice axe and crampons is prudent if going high. There is an old saying - ""Sometimes it is better to be at home wishing you were on a mountain, than on a mountain wishing you were at home"".

On exits from both Swirral and Striding Edges onto the summit plateau today the snow had all but gone, but not quite completely. Any lowering of the temperature over the next few days (although not currently forecast) would soon turn these remaining patches into very hard snow. Owing to this, for those attempting exposed routes above the snowline, an ice axe might still be found useful. Throughout the morning the cloud base hung at around 350m, and heavy rain eased occasionally to a mere drizzle. Gale force SW winds made the crossing of both edges challenging, and had the wind turned more to the south Striding Edge in particular would have been out of the question. The other notable challenge today was navigation, with visibility reduced for much of the time to around 10m.

However there are still large areas of hard icy snow above 650m which are unavoidable on some routes. They are predominantly found in sheltered spots and hollows and on north and east facing aspects including the steep exits from both Striding and Swirral Edges.This snow was laid down earlier in the winter and has now gone through the freeze thaw process a number of times. It is now well consolidated and very resistant to a thaw. Today with summit temperatures well above freezing it was still frozen hard with a significant amount of ice and the expectation is that this will remain in place for a number of days or weeks. If you chose to cross patches of snow then you should be fully equipped with ice axe and crampons. Crampons are there to stop you slipping in the first place and an ice axe will prevent a slip becoming something far worse. The consequences of an uncontrolled slide are now very serious with many runouts into boulder fields or over cliffs. These can be very hazardous conditions for walkers requiring the correct equipment and experience to assess the risk and make good decisions. This advice includes the snow bank on the exit from Striding Edge onto the Helvellyn plateau, the 'easier' path on the northern side of the ridge and the whole of the final climb and exit on Swirral Edge. Swirls Steep on the paths from Thirlmere also has a significant snow patch to cross which has been the cause of a number of accidents this season. There are still large cornices on N through E to S facing slopes many of which are slumping and cracking. These will become progressively weaker and more unstable with the milder temperatures. Please give them a wide berth and advise other walkers with less experience likewise. Temperatures on the summits are still regularly below freezing and the weather can change dramatically. Waterproof and warm layers, hats, gloves, map & compass, a survival bag & torch and a fully charged mobile phone should all be carried throughout the year to give you a safe and enjoyable day on the Lake District fells.

This report should be read with a Health Warning! At the time of writing, more snow is forecast above 600m, so walkers out on Thursday should expect to encounter different conditions to those described and experienced today. There is an extensive thaw at all levels (it was plus 2 degrees and drizzling on the summit at midday). The thaw is mainly affecting the recent soft snow that has settled over recent days but is, so far, having little effect on the older, harder snow that has been on the fells for months and which has undergone a thaw and severe freeze cycle. This old, hard snow is located above 650m and especially above 850m. Some of it is now covered by a layer of fresh, soft, wet snow creating an unstable layer of 2 to 5 cm – this was particularly noticeable on Swirral Edge today.

Despite the appearance of Spring in the valleys, the summit windchill remains below freezing, so full winter clothing, footwear and equipment are essential for anyone venturing out into the fells. For those attempting, or traversing, steep slopes above the snowline crampons and ice axe are also essential – this is due to the amount of old, hard snow. Unfortunately, if recent experience is anything to go by, there will be folk out on steep snow without proper winter equipment. The question that they should ask themselves is “How do I stop myself falling down a steep, snow slope without an ice axe?” Crampons are there to stop you slipping in the first place and an ice axe will prevent a slip becoming something far worse. Excellent navigational skills are also required especially when snow is falling and/or in cloud as the deep snow obscures all landmarks creating challenging route finding."

A wet morning, with rain at all levels, and summit temperatures above zero. With this, the latest thaw, the snowpack on the fells is complex. The snowline today was about 400m, and thawing rapidly. Below 650m the snow was very wet and slushy. Above 650m the old snow, that has been on the fells for some weeks now (the old, dirty-looking stuff) was still hard and icy today. In places there were patches of slightly newer snow, that fell a couple of days ago, and that was thawing rapidly, right up to summit level. Also in patches, there are a few sheltered areas holding fresh snow that fell yesterday and throughout the night. This was still very fresh today, and soft. This layering in the snowpack is what often sets alarm bells ringing, as it can lead to avalanche dangers. However, today in the thaw, the main trigger of avalanche is actually likely to be the cornices on N through E to S facing slopes, that have been there for a long time, and started to slump some weeks ago. With the thaw these could easily collapse, so it is not a good time to be testing their stability. All walking routes on Helvellyn involve crossing large areas of snow. An ice axe and crampons are essential if you want to make a safe ascent and descent. Remember, coming down a mountain is usually a lot more difficult than going up, so if in doubt, turn around in plenty of time. The summit of any mountain is only the half-way point! Both Striding and Swirral Edges are still in full winter condition, as are the walking routes from Wythburn Chapel, Swirls, and via Whiteside to the north, and Grisedale Tarn to the south. There were climbers on Brown Cove Crags today, but only the easy gullies (Broad Gully, Left Parallel, and Right Parallel) are complete. The assessor descended Broad Gully and found the snow to still be bomber neve for the whole length of the gully. Other routes should be avoided so as not to damage the habitat, other than the summer scrambles on Brown Cove Crags (where an axe and crampons shouldn't be needed). Even though the weather improved markedly this afternoon, walkers should remember just how wet and miserable it was this morning.

We will endeavour to visit the summit of Helvellyn each day during this period, but if this is not possible we will write a daily report based on current forecasts. We will review our end date for the service next weekend. A wild and moist day in the Lake District. In some areas of the Park snow has fallen down to valley level, and continued to fall throughout the day. On Helvellyn the snow line was just above the car parks, and even at that height was 5cm in depth. The snow depth increased with height gained, and in drifts above Brown Cove Crags the depth of fresh snow was up to 50cm in places. This, coupled with the old hard snow beneath gave a total snow depth of up to 150cm, although this was the exception. The strong wind gave considerable buffeting at times, and with a cloud base set at around 400m-500m (and even lower in falling snow), visibility was much reduced. Blizzard conditions prevailed above 400m, and there were periods of whiteout lasting up to 15 minutes at a time. Cornices still exist on N through E to S facing headwalls, corrie rims, and gully tops, and these would have been building further with the fresh snow today, but the Fell Top Assessor stayed well clear in the poor visibility as it is oh so easy to fall through a cornice. Perhaps not surprisingly, the fells were quieter today, as most people decided that this was not a good day to go high in the mountains. Most of the people the assessor met were cheerful, as they were dressed appropriately and had the equipment to deal with hard, snowy ground. The only exception to this was a chap with very blue legs who seemed to have forgotten to put his trousers on today. Remember, full waterproofs are essential, including overtrousers. All walking routes on Helvellyn are currently snowbound and should be regarded as winter mountaineering. This includes the so-called 'easy' walks from Swirls and Wythburn on Thirlmere - the site of quite a few walker accidents this season, and sadly one fatality. This is not the time to attempt the high fells thinking you're just going for a stroll.

The assessor found snow up to 100cm deep in some of the gullies today, whereas on the more open hillsides any patches are generally around 40cm in depth. Paths on Helvellyn were icy in places, and some of these snowy areas are not avoidable on all walking routes. On Striding Edge and Swirral Edge there is still a fair amount of snow, although exposed rocks were dry today. The exits from both ridges are still steep banks of snow requiring the use of an ice axe and crampons to make a safe ascent or descent. There are large cracks appearing in cornices facing N through E to S, and evidence of further small avalanches where cornices have collapsed. Please stay well away from corniced edges. Red Tarn is still semi frozen, but is not safe to try to walk upon. Climbers should note that most winter routes are not in climbable condition, but some easy snow gullies still give good sport, where they are not beneath unstable cornices! On Brown Cove Crags only Broad Gully, Central Gully, and both Parallel Gullies were complete. The assessor found the snow in Right Parallel Gully today to be surprisingly hard and stable, whereas in Broad Gully it was softer and slushy. Climbers in Central Gully also reported soft snow conditions. Although we've had a lovely day in the fells, this is not the time to become complacent and expect lovely weather every day.

Striding Edge and Swirral Edge both still have some snow, but also a fair bit of exposed rock which felt very slippery today in the wet conditions. The exits from both ridges onto the summit plateau is still very snowy, and this can't be avoided. There are cornices on headwalls and ridges facing N through to SE and these are old and visibly slumping. In places the cornices have collapsed, and more will fall if the temperatures remain mild. Visibility was an issue today with the cloud base being as low as 400m at times. Above that height visibility was reduced to between 10m and 40m at best. Good waterproofs and warmth layers were needed today, as the temperature was hovering around zero above 850m. Given the wind chill, and the damp conditions, it felt quite cold today.

Where rock is exposed it is free of ice and today was wet and slippery. The exits from the ridges onto the Helvellyn summit plateau are both steep banks of snow. Today they were soft enough to enable steps to be kicked into them with the aid of a stiff winter walking boot, but should temperatures drop just a few degrees all the snow that remains on the high fells will turn very hard, very quickly. Red Tarn was still frozen today, but visibly thawing. There are cornices on headwalls, gully tops, and ridges facing N through E to S, and these were visibly slumping in some places with cracks appearing today.

Unfortunately there is a major thaw and heavy rain forecast for tomorrow, so much of the snow may vanish, which would be a shame. Today however, because of the hard snow, an ice axe and crampons were essential for anyone heading for the tops. Upland tarns are frozen, but are not safe to walk upon. There are cornices on slopes facing N through E to S, and these are composed of old snow with nothing much below them other than a very long drop into the valleys below - stay off the cornices to be safe. There is evidence of cornice slumping, and also of cornice collapse in some areas, with small cones of avalanche debris visible on many slopes facing NE through to SE. Climbing conditions were superb on Brown Cove Crags today, with some very fine ice in places, good neve throughout (admittedly with occasional small areas of windslab on top), and frozen turf. The cornices on Brown Cove Crags are small, whereas over the Red Tarn face they are huge, which explains why there have been few climbers venturing onto the Red Tarn climbs in the last few days. Again, bearing in mind the forecasted thaw tomorrow, climbers should be aware of further cornice collapse, and should make careful assessments of any climbs over the next few days, assuming there is still snow left to climb! Full winter clothing and equipment are essential for exploring the fells at present, including an ice axe and crampons.

Apart from where it has been compacted or drifted, there is now little snow at valley level especially in the west and south of the Park.

On exposed slopes the ground is scoured by the wind, but on leeward slopes, and other sheltered places there are large drifts of soft, dry powder. The assessor found a few that were deep enough to completely swallow a fell top assessor! Most of the drifts however are around 100cm in depth on westerly slopes, and on high ground these drifts may lie on top of old hard neve, giving very weakly bonded layers to a maximum depth of 170cm.With further snow forecast for the next couple of days for east Cumbria, walking and climbing conditions in the mountains could be very arduous. This fresh snow is not stable at all, and where it is accumulating you can expect not only extremely tiring walking, but there is potential for high avalanche risks too. With biting winds today giving very low windchill, and a lot of driving spindrift, any movement in the hills was difficult, while visibility was appalling for long periods of time. Whiteout conditions were frequent.Anyone thinking of heading into the hills will need the full range of winter clothing and equipment, and should be confident in assessing avalanche risks, as well as having excellent navigation skills with a map and compass.

Avalanche hasty pits dug on both north facing and south facing slopes above 650m both revealed a high avalanche risk. Walkers and climbers should take great care to assess the slopes they intend to climb, descend or traverse, and you should think about accumulations of snow further up the mountain that may also avalanche.

Striding Edge and Swirral Edge can only safely be ascended or descended with an ice axe and crampons. On Striding Edge, the crest of the ridge is bare rock, but the exit from the ridge onto Helvellyn is a steep bank of hard snow. On Swirral Edge there is more snow, and again the exit onto the plateau is a steep bank of hard, unavoidable snow. A slip from here would result in a 300m fall, over rocks, into the valley below. Red Tarn is frozen, and only the foolish would try walking on its surface. Sadly, there were a few fools out there today. Think about how quickly you would loose heat from your body if you broke through into the icy water, and think about how long it would take mountain rescue to reach you if that happened. Chances of survival are very slim. Climbers today found great snow in the easy gullies, and some ice elsewhere, but the buttress routes are not climbable as winter climbs, as there is no snow, ice, or rime on the rocks at present. Anyone heading out in the fells will need full waterproofs and warmth layers, as well as map and compass, an ice axe and crampons, and a headtorch."

Higher on Helvellyn there is still substantial snow cover, although areas that have been exposed to the sun over the last couple of days are more snow free than north-facing slopes. Striding Edge today was interesting in that the scramble along the crest of the ridge was very much in summer condition, with lovely dry rock for most of the way. However, for anyone wanting to avoid the crest, the 'path' that people tend to follow on the Red Tarn side of the Edge is currently in full winter condition, and is no place to be without an ice axe and crampons. In such bullet hard snow a slip from here would be very difficult to halt, even with the correct technique for an ice axe arrest. The exit from Striding Edge is a very steep bank of hard snow, and again an axe and crampons are essential here. On Swirral Edge the conditions throughout are more wintry than Striding, although there is some exposed rock in places. The exit from Swirral is also a steep bank of very hard snow. All other walking routes on Helvellyn involve crossing patches of very hard snow, and any walker heading for the heights will need an ice axe and crampons. There is a huge cornice on N through to SE-facing slopes, and there is a lot of evidence of avalanche debris where chunks of cornice have broken off in the last few days. Stay well away from cornices, even in the current hard snow conditions. Red Tarn is frozen but is obviously not safe to walk upon. The same goes for other upland tarns. Climbers today found good winter sport in gullies, and some ice routes are currently in. However, buttress routes are very much clear of snow at the moment. On The Red Tarn face today climbers were enjoying Gully 1, 2 & 3, and it looked like a team having a look at V Corner also, but it did look very thin.

On the fells the snow line is currently around 250m, and with heavy snow above 300m it gave for challenging walking. The snow is drifting in many sheltered places, behind boulders, knolls and gully rims, not just on leeward aspects of the mountains, so the depth is constantly varying, from a general covering of about 40cm in depth, to bigger drifts up to 170cm deep. The wind is carving these drifts as the direction is changing and is very localised, and some drifts, even at low levels, have mini-cornices, and in places, ridges of snow up to 200cm in depth. Walking today involved every step being arduous, with one step landing on hard snow, the next landing the walker in a huge soft drift, and the next partially taking the walker's weight, then collapsing and depositing him in a deep drift just as he transferred his weight onto the surface. A good sense of humour was just as important as the right clothing and equipment today. There is much cross-loading of snow, and windslab was forming as low as 500m on NE through to S facing slopes. A hasty pit dug at 650m on an E facing slope revealed 6 distinct layers of windslab above a harder snow layer, and gentle hand pressure on an isolated block of snow gave a snow slide at about 40cm depth, giving a High category avalanche risk on those slopes. It is very likely that a similar High avalanche risk exists on all slopes facing NE through to S, and with the wind being in the south today, this will probably change to include NW through to N slopes overnight tonight. In periods of blizzard today visibility was generally around 50m, although short periods of whiteout where also frequent. Full winter clothing was essential today - double waterproofs were the only way of staying even remotely dry.

Visibility in the morning was appalling in driving snow - reduced to just two or three metres at times if heading directly into the wind. There was occasional whiteout, even at low levels. With the wind in the NW snow was being deposited mainly on NE through to S facing slopes, and those 6-7 metre cornices we've had over the last couple of days on these aspects were building even further. Stay well back from cornices, as they are a lot larger than you might think! By early afternoon the snow had stopped falling, and blue skies revealed the fells in all their winter glory. Views were exceptionally good. The snow, however, is deep, making for hard walking. There is instability on most slopes at present, and walkers, climbers and skiers should make sensible choices about route, avoiding convex slopes, corrie rims, gullies, and crag aprons that face NE through to S. Other aspects need a proper assessment by the individual walker to judge whether there is any chance of an avalanche until the snow settles and becomes better consolidated. With more snow forecast, and temperatures largely staying below zero on the fells for the next few days (but with some fluctuations) it is an interesting time to be enjoying the fells.

Snow goggles were essential if your route took you into the wind, as it was impossible to see without them. Walkers should note that the wind speeds recorded today were taken at the summit of St Sunday Crag, but there was a noticeable increase in speeds later in the afternoon during the descent.

The Helvellyn Edges today had a lot of icy ground, with occasional bare rock. Where the rock is not ice covered there is very little rime. The exit from Swirral Edge today was an extremely steep bank of very hard snow (almost vertical for the last two metres onto the summit plateau).

This fresh snow is around 2cm in depth generally, but where it has gathered on lee slopes and behind boulders, it is up to 60cm in depth, even at valley level. Higher up the mountain the snow is being redeposited onto lee slopes, and windslab is building on N through to SE facing slopes. On Striding and Swirral Edges the snow is deep in sheltered places, and the exits from both ridges are composed of 100cm deep, unstable windslab overlying hard, old snow.

There are, however, some sizeable patches of snow in drifts, especially on NE through to SE facing slopes above 600m. This is especially true for headwalls, corrie rims, and tops of gullies, although any leeward slope may have a snow drift behind it. Some of these drifts are up to a depth of 40cm of new snow, so where this lies on top of any areas of old hard snow above 700m the total depth is now around 110cm. This is the exception however. Where this new snow overlies the old, there is considerable instability, and it will take some redistribution and consolidation before things become stable. In the meantime, more snow is forecast, so tomorrow could be just as interesting as today. Small cornices are starting to develop on NE through to SE corrie rims, so care is needed when walking around the tops of these. The Helvellyn edges required care in the fresh snow and verglas today, and the exits from both ridges were soft windslab on top of old hard neve - a recipe for a slide if the snow depth here continues to build. The freezing level today was at around 650m, although some paths felt icy below that height. Rocks were coated in verglas in places above that height. For climbers, gullies are starting to look a little whiter than they have, but it's very early days for this particular phase of the winter season. Buttresses were largely black, and the turf is nowhere near frozen, but the Great End temperature gauge is at least heading in the right direction again.

With the turbo thaw we've had over the last three days, followed by colder weather, any remaining old snow, which is confined above the 750m mark, is now very hard, and requires an ice axe and crampons. Most walking routes are free of the old snow however. That said, the exits from Striding Edge and Swirral Edge involve crossing unavoidable patches of this old, hard snow, and a slip or trip here will result in a very long plummet over icy, rocky ground which will only be halted 800 feet further down the mountain where the angle eases. An ice axe is the only thing that will stop such a slip becoming a full-length slide.

However, a significant amount of snow remains with the average depth rising with altitude. The deepest drifts, of over 100cm, are to be found above 700m on N to E to S facing slopes. Even at 600m, there are drifts above knee height in sheltered spots and hollows. The vast majority of the snowpack is now soft and very wet. There are two exceptions to this: Firstly, where the snow has been compacted on popular routes with isolated patches of ice sometimes “hidden” amongst sections of slush. Secondly above 900m there was some neve (hard snow) – eg on the final exit to Swirral Edge. There are cornices above N to E to S facing slopes. Owing to limited visibility, it was difficult to assess their stability, but those that could be seen appeared highly unstable so please keep well back from such edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise. Climbers: with the milder temperatures, the gullies are now full of very wet, soft snow with, as mentioned above, unstable cornices above. The only place where the assessor found a substantial amount of ice was on the summit plateau which was covered in it making conditions extremely dangerous for anyone without crampons – especially given the strength of the W wind blowing you towards the edge! Despite the milder temperatures in the valleys, full winter clothing, footwear and equipment remain essential for anyone venturing out into the fells. For those visiting the high fells, crampons and ice axe must also be carried in case ice is encountered; this advice is not just for those not attempting steep routes owing to, as mentioned above, the ice on the summit plateau. Anyone attempting, or traversing, steep routes above the snowline also need the ability to assess the stability, or otherwise, of the predominantly wet and heavy snowpack. Excellent navigational skills are also essential, especially for anyone venturing into cloud as the deep snow obscures all landmarks creating challenging route finding.

Temperatures are also forecast to rise with rain falling at lower levels – which is now (2pm) happening in Ambleside. Owing to road conditions, the assessor did not climb a high fell today, but found plenty of winter on Wansfell Pike instead! Fresh snow has fallen at all levels adding to the substantial accumulations on the fells. The snow depth rises with height with the deepest drifts of over 100cm to be found above 700m on N to E to S facing slopes. Even at 450m, there were drifts above knee height in sheltered spots and hollows. The snowpack is very soft and this, combined with the depth, makes walking much more of an effort – route planning should take this into consideration. Conversely, on popular routes the snow has been compacted and this hard snow/ice now lies beneath a layer of fresh snow making for slippery conditions that are difficult to see. Although on Saturday there had been a slight consolidation of the snowpack those slopes loaded with the most snow (facing N to E to S above 700m) remained soft and unstable owing to their layers not having bonded and on Monday they will contain even more snow. Anyone climbing, skiing, traversing or simply walking beneath such slopes should only be there if they have the knowledge to assess their stability otherwise please stay well clear as there have been recent avalanches on such slopes. A thaw/freeze cycle will obviously help their consolidation. There are also cornices above such potentially unstable slopes so please keep well back from their edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise. Full winter clothing, footwear and equipment – including ice axe and crampons – are required for anyone venturing out into the medium to high fells; this includes those not attempting steep routes. For example, crampons were useful on the summit plateau on Saturday which was covered in verglas (thin ice) where the snow had been scoured by the wind.

The undisturbed snowpack is very soft and this, combined with the depth, makes for tiring walking – extra time and Mars Bars (other calorific snacks are available) should be allowed for this. Conversely, on popular routes the snow has been compacted making for slippery conditions and below 350m, walkers out early on Sunday should expect to encounter ice on paths where any of Saturday’s thawed snow has refrozen overnight.

Today the assessor ascended the western side of Helvellyn – ie the windward side. Especially on and near the summit plateau there were areas of ground covered in verglas (thin ice) which had been scoured by the wind. However, in sheltered hollows, even on the windward side, there were drifts up to knee depth. Conversely on lee slopes above 700m there were drifts up to 150cm. Although such depth is the exception a rough average is between 20 and 30cm. The snowpack is very soft and this, combined with the depth, makes walking far more exhausting than normal and this must be considered when planning a route. Owing to lack of visibility, the assessor was unable to check for cornices and the stability of the snowpack on lee slopes. However, on Thursday it was reported that slopes especially those facing N to E to S were highly unstable above 700m with small avalanches being reported. Today further hail and spindrift will have added to existing accumulations making them potentially even more unstable especially when the soft snow/hail sits above hard snow. Anyone climbing, skiing, traversing or simply beneath such slopes should only be there if they have the knowledge to assess their stability otherwise please stay well clear. The showers, together with low cloud, made for extremely challenging navigation with excellent navigational skills being essential. Literally one minute the route was clearly visible and the next visibility was reduced to virtually zero with blinding, stinging hail/spindrift together with the snow obscuring all landmarks.

At valley level the depth was around 5-10cm, but at 300m there were small drifts up to 50cm deep, although the general covering was around 15-20cm. Above 700m some of the drifts were up to 150cm in depth, requiring very tiring wading to make any headway on foot. To day the assessor abandoned his attempt on the edges due to the large amounts of unstable snow on most aspects. The exit from Swirral Edge towards the summit plateau was dangerously soft snow overlying the old hard snow, and the assessor deemed it unsafe to continue. He took his readings further down the ridge on the col below Catstycam. A good lesson in knowing when to turn back. Apart from the obvious avalanche risks (which today was on most aspects above 600m) the other main concern today was navigation, as visibility was reduced to less than 10m for long periods of time, and there were also short periods of whiteout conditions. Small avalanches have been reported on various slopes by members of the public during the day, and it is hoped that walkers, climbers and skiers will only head up into the higher fells if they have the experience and judgement to make proper decisions about the stability of the snowpack. Today the assessor found a High avalanche risk on slopes facing N through E to S above 700m, and a Considerable avalanche risk on most other aspects above 600m. There was a noticeable thaw during the afternoon which should help the snow consolidate, so hopefully by the weekend things will have settled down quite a bit. Check the assessor's report tomorrow afternoon for a further update though! Climbers should note that most climbs will be loaded with unstable snow at present. Patience, and picking the right route for the conditions is the key when it comes to winter climbing! Walkers should make sure they have all the right mountain clothing and equipment for the hills at present. A map and compass and good navigation skills are essential, and today snow goggles were an absolute must. An ice axe and crampons should always be carried in the winter hills."

On Helvellyn the snow has gathered on lee slopes, and the depth varies enormously. At 300m there were drifts behind boulders and spurs to a depth of 100cm, and up to 180cm at 800m. These depths were the exception however, with much scouring on any slopes exposed to the winds. In sheltered places there is a dramatic build up of snow that is very poorly bonded to the layers beneath. At between 720m and 800m in Broad Gully on Brown Cove Crags the layering consisted of a very hard bottom layer of old snow, covered with up to 40cm of graupel (hail), covered with up to 10cm of windblown slab. This windslab was breaking into very large chunks, the size of table tops, with very little weight from the assessor's foot, and sliding down on the graupel which acts as ball-bearings on the hard surface below. This is exactly the kind of dangerous snow build-up that the assessor mentioned starting to see yesterday. There is a very similar snow profile on major slopes facing NW through E to SE, but also more localised on smaller slopes that are sheltered from the wind. On these aspects there is a High risk of avalanche. This includes headwalls, the tops, flanks, and aprons of gullies, tops of ridges (including Striding Edge and Swirral Edge) and buttresses, and open slopes. Another weather feature today was the variable visibility. This was at times good, but extremely poor in falling snow. Good navigational ability is essential in these conditions. Climbers will note the information on avalanche-prone slopes above, and if thinking of a climb will pick a suitable route accordingly. Buttresses looked very thin today, and turf is only frozen in patches above 800m. Anyone heading into the hills at present will need the full range of winter mountain walking gear, experience, and technical knowledge. An ice axe and crampons are essential, as is a map and compass."

Snow at all levels made for tricky walking today, with ice on paths above 450m. This was patchy at that level, and varied enormously, from vergals on rocks to thick, old compressed snow-ice. Above 550m the snow covering was more even, and with lots of fresh snowy squalls coming through during the late morning and early afternoon this was drifting on N through E to S aspects. The deepest drifts encountered were above 750m, to a depth of 120cm, but deeper drifts almost certainly do exist at present, and will be topped up further as more snowy showers move through. Windslab is developing on slopes facing N through E to S, and some cross-loading was observed as the wind direction was locally very variable. Graupel also fell in heavy showers during periods, and this could lead to avalanche complications if it fails to consolidate. Visibility also varied from good views of distant peaks to just a few metres in snow showers. This made for challenging navigation at times. Climbers will note that some of the Great End gully lines are starting to fill, although none looked complete from bottom to top today. Central Gully will not take much more time to be climbable, and the Left Branch had good ice developing. Window Gully also has good ice developing, while Cust's Gully isn't quite there yet, with more snow needed, but Branch Gully was good with just a small ice pitch at the bottom. South-East Gully isn't climbable yet, and should be avoided at present so as not to damage the only Cumbrian habitat for Dwarf Cornel. Buttress routes are not frozen yet either, and today were black, showing a lack of rime ice.

The 3m cornices that are on NE through to SE facing slopes have developed further cracks, and there is a likelihood that today's thaw could bring cornice collapse on any aspect where the danger is present. The Edges on Helvellyn today were icy throughout, but the rocks are currently black where yesterday's rime ice has thawed. As temperatures drop this will turn to verglas, then back to rime ice.

Rain fell from valley level upwards for much of the day, but above 600m this was falling as sleet, and above 750m as wet snow. With a freezing level at around 900m for most of the morning, Striding Edge and Swirral Edge both had fresh snow, but where rocks were still exposed they were wet and slippery, but with no sign of rime ice or verglas. However, as the forecast is for temperatures to fall from this evening through until the weeked, we can expect the wet snow to further consolidate, and for exposed rocks to become ice covered. Snow remains on the exits from Striding and Swirral Edges onto the summit plateau, and today there was a noticeable layering effect where the old snow has become very stable and consolidated, and the new, fresh snow is laying on top. There is some instability here, and on other headwalls facing NE through to SE, but generally the snow is bonding well. The snow depth on these leeward flanks was at a maximum of 100cm, but this was the exception. In most places the snow is at an average depth of 20cm - 30cm, but there are also large areas above 700m where the ground is free of snow at present. With a cloud base generally at around 550m, but lowering in heavy rain, visibility was poor for much of the day. Above 550m it was often reduced to no more than 10m, making it difficult for the assessor to report on the overall general coverage of snow. No winter climbs were in worthwhile condition today, and anyone attempting any route that relies on frozen turf would have been a) very disappointed, and b) causing damage to a rare wildlife habitat. It is worth noting that the BMC have installed additional temperature sensors on Helvellyn at a height of 830m, so that we can see if turf if frozen. Please use this great resource when planning your winter climbing adventures. The website link is: https://www.thebmc.co.uk/great-end-winter-conditions Anyone heading for the heights at present will need a good sense of humour in addition to excellent waterproofs and warmth layers, including spare hats and gloves.

The snow that fell on the high fells yesterday has all but thawed in last night's mild but stormy weather. The hillsides are now stripped of snow below 750m, with the only areas with any amount of covering being on north through to southeast facing headwalls above that height. Paths were snow covered above 650m, but only where the snow has become compressed by walkers feet. Today the cloud base was between 700m and 850m, giving generally good visibility below that height. For the most part the day was dry, with just a few showers of hail and sleet. Walkers heading for the heights will need full winter clothing and boots.

The rise in temperature followed by further freezing will help to consolidate the snowpack, but at present there is some noticeable layering within the pack, and on N through to E facing slopes above 800m this was found to show a moderate avalanche hazard this morning.

The paths were snowy and icy above 650m. On Swirral Edge there is currently a good amount of snow, with rime and verglas on rocks, making crampons a very sensible option. The exit from Swirral onto the Helvellyn plateau is currently a steep bank of windslab snow, which felt reasonably stable today. It was alarming to watch people sliding down this steep bank on their bums, with a very long drop over craggy ground beneath them. This has been the scene of a number of accidents in the past, with people doing exactly this, and an unchecked slide can become a 300m (1000ft) plummet down the mountain. Not a good way to start the New Year. An ice axe here will help stop a slide, and crampons give perfect traction to avoid a slide in the first place. Why would you risk doing Striding Edge or Swirral Edge in winter without them? On East facing headwalls and in other sheltered places the snow depth is around 100cm. The freezing level today was at around 900m, with ground frozen above that height. Crampons on the summit plateau were a great help. With the cloud base ranging between 800m and 1000m visibility was poor at times as the cloud base dropped. No climbs are in condition at present, although snow was falling during the afternoon above 600m, so gullies could start to fill with snow now. Cornices and unstable windslab on NE to SE facing slopes will become further loaded, giving considerable avalanche dangers over the coming days. Anyone heading onto the fells should have all the usual winter clothing, boots, ice axe and crampons, and a map and compass.

The snowline has receded overnight, to a height this morning of around 700m. Even above this height it was quite patchy in places, although there are still some sizeable snow drifts on the plateau, and especially on N-SE facing slopes. Headwalls are getting very banked out, and cornices are present on these aspects. Windslab is noticeable on these aspects too, with around 5cm of windslab covering some wet snow in places to a depth of 70cm, but in other areas the snow below the windslab was dry graupel, resembling polystyrene balls. Although the snowpack is diminishing, this instability should be noted by anyone heading into the hills. Snow and ice on paths was wet and slushy by and large today, but was firmer in places, although for the most part this could be avoided. With a cloud base ranging between 800m and just above the summits today, views were good at times. The main weather feature today was indeed the storm force winds, which on occasion threw the assessor off his feet and reduced him to crawling for short periods of time. The wind speed did abate slightly during the descent, but walking was still difficult. No winter climbs are in condition at the moment - please wait until the temperatures drop when any remaining snow will become firm and climbable. Today an ice axe and crampons were not used, although of course the assessor had them with him anyway. Should the temperatures drop slightly, the paths will become very icy and the summit plateau will freeze, making these tools of the winter walker absolutely essential.

This morning the snow level was at 300m, but by the end of the day this had risen to around 400m. There is currently snow and ice on paths above 400m, and this is slippery in places requiring care, and perhaps crampons. Above 650m the snow on paths is quite firm, caused mainly due to compression rather than consolidation. This snow is deep in places, up to 70cm on NE to S facing slopes, although generally the snow depth is around 10cm. Exits from Striding Edge and Swirral Edge are snow bound, and this is very steep ground requiring the use of an ice axe for safely gaining or descending from the summit on these ridges. Today there were far too many people sliding down the Swirral Edge exit on their bums, completely out of control. Below this bank of snow is a 300m (1000ft) drop over craggy, snowy ground. An ice axe will stop a little slip becoming a full scale slide down the mountain if used properly. There are currently cornices on N through to SE facing slopes. These are currently small, but still pose a danger to the unwary. Today no climbs were really in condition. The turf is not frozen, and the ice that does exist was thawing. Please avoid climbing in areas were rare flora can be damaged if the turf isn't frozen, such as the headwall cliffs of the Red Tarn Cove, Brown Cove Crags, Nethermost Pike and Dollywaggon Pike, and Great End.

Once there, you'll have found deep snow in drifts on leeward slopes and in sheltered places. The assessor found that these drifts were chiefly on NW through to NE facing slopes (as the wind through the night was largely SE to S), but there was a good covering on most aspects as the winds generally were quite light. Above 500m the snow and slush on paths had become icy, and at 550m the Assessor today put on crampons whilst heading for Striding Edge. Higher on the hill - above 750m on Striding Edge, the snow had gathered in drifts up to 70cm deep, so the crampons came off again. The top of both Striding Edge and Swirral Edge today were banks of deep, soft, unconsolidated snow which felt quite unstable. An ice axe here certainly made for a safer ascent or descent, and as the day wore on and temperatures rose there was some melting which will aid snow consolidation the next time it freezes. Cornices were forming on slopes facing NW through to NE, and the Helvellyn summit plateau today was partially snow-covered, and partially scoured by the wind. Where the ground was exposed it was frozen, and this patchy ice covering made deciding whether or not to wear crampons a problem. Today with deep snow and rising temperatures it seemed unlikely that any winter climbs would have been in condition. Certainly turf is not frozen at present. With unstable snow on exits from many climbs, you would need the ability to assess for avalanche hazards before attempting any climb. All winter climbers should first think about the weather and snow conditions, and if turf is frozen, and then pick a suitable route for those conditions. Anyone heading for the hills, whether walking or climbing, should have full waterproofs and warmth layers, including spare hats and gloves. Winter boots and properly adjusted crampons are essential, as is an ice axe and the knowledge of how to use these. A map and compass and good navigation skills are essential - today with a cloud base at around 650m, visibility above that height was often reduced to just 20m or so.

The snow depth rises with height, although, as ever, the actual depth varies considerably from only 1-2cm on windswept areas to drifts over 70cm on S and E facing slopes at 900m, although such depth is the exception. The snow pack is generally very soft. Exceptions are where it has been compacted on popular routes and in places where a light crust has formed. Raised footprints on windswept areas and some windslab on lee slopes (predominantly S and E facing) illustrated that the fresh snow has been re-deposited. Especially below 400m, there was ice on paths where it had frozen overnight. Exposed routes above the snowline, such as Striding and Swirral Edges, require care, a knowledge of winter mountaineering and an ice axe to negotiate safely. Although the snowpack is currently soft, it could harden – so crampons should also be carried – indeed several people had them on today.

Conditions improved rapidly this afternoon with sunshine and good visibility between the clouds Above 350m there was a good covering of ankle deep soft snow which increased slowly with height. Swirral Edge had collected more snow than Striding Edge with drifting up to calf deep and there were a few easily avoidable areas of soft slab developing.

North westerly winds were light but there has been some movement of snow and the cornices over the east face were starting to build again. Crampons and ice axe weren't used today however a small drop in temperature will transform the new snow into a far more serious proposition requiring full winter equipment and skills.

There is now very little snow below 650m, and even above that height it is patchy. The bulk of the snow on Helvellyn lies on east through to south-facing slopes - this is the snow that was laid down during those westerly, then northerly winds that we had a few days ago. On these aspects the snow lies in wet drifts up to 70cm in depth. On Striding Edge and Swirral Edge the rocks are now largely free of snow, but exits onto the summit plateau are currently banks of steep, semi-frozen snow requiring care to cross safely. An ice axe here was found useful. With a cloud base today at 550m, visibility was reduced to around 30m at times, making navigation tricky. A map and compass are essential for safe travel in the hills at present. Although the temperatures are hovering just above zero today, warmth layers under good waterproofs were essential. A headtorch is also essential - don't forget it gets dark early at this time of year! Today an ice axe was only needed for crossing occasional banks of snow, but crampons were not used. However, should temperatures drop very slightly the remaining snow will become bullet-hard, and crampons will then be essential too."

With a cloud base lowering throughout the morning to around 400m at times during the afternoon, visibility above that height was restricted to less than 50m for long periods. The day was largely dry, but occasional drizzle and a good wetting from being inside a cloud all day made for a damp walk. The snowpack is reducing in size, but where snow still lies, largely above 550m now, there are still some sizeable areas of ground covered with patches up to 70cm deep. Paths still have ice on them, despite the thawing conditions, and above 650m this varied from slushy, wet ice to harder areas that required crampons. Striding and Swirral Edges still both have snow in places, and the exits from both ridges are steep banks of snow which is well bonded and hard, with just a soft, wet surface. This requires care to negotiate, and an ice axe will make you feel safer and in full control of your destiny here! Apart from the very variable snow and ice conditions on the high fells, another challenge today was navigation. A map and compass and solid navigation skills are needed if you want to have an enjoyable and safe walk. This is not the time to rely on electronic devices that: a) can't think; b) can't see what the snow and ice conditions are like underfoot; and c) rely on batteries that don't like cold weather. Other equipment that will help you have an enjoyable, safe mountain walk at this time of year includes full waterproofs, winter mountain boots, lots of warmth layers, woolly hats and waterproof gloves, a nice packed lunch with a hot drink, and a headtorch. Come with the correct clothing and equipment, and you'll have a great time on the high fells."

Yesterday's partial thaw coupled with a sharp drop in temperature overnight has helped to consolidate the remaining snowpack, giving good conditions for walking. The paths were icy above 400m, where old snow and ice has become more compacted, and on all paths above this height crampons were essential. On steeper ground, such as on the exits from Striding Edge and Swirral Edge, an ice axe was also needed to aid safety. The rocks at all levels are now almost bare of ice, and there was no rime ice or hoar frost visible at any level. However, there was some snow and ice in gullies above Red Tarn, and here it was good, solid stuff, giving pleasant climbing conditions. Climbs relying on frozen turf are not currently in condition. Red Tarn is partially frozen, but is clearly not safe to walk on, and the same can be said for all upland tarns. There are cornices on headwalls facing north through to south-east, and while these currently are not very large, care is required when approaching them from either above or below. Today visibility was generally very good, with the cloud-base hovering around the highest summits, but the forecast for the next couple of days is for hillfog so you'll need to be able to navigate accurately to stay away from cornices. Full winter clothing and equipment is needed for walking in the fells at the moment.

The thawing snow made for difficult walking conditions, as every step was different, from wading through deep, soggy drifts to balancing carefully on still-frozen patches. This made for hard walking, and this coupled with reduced visibility gave a challenging day for anyone venturing onto the fells. The snow at its deepest was up to 80cm today, but further thawing overnight may reduce this. There are cornices on aspects from north through to south-east, and some of these have slumped and are ready to fall. Stay well back from these bottomless waves of snow. Where snow and ice has fallen from crags there have been a number of small sluffs, and any continuing thaw will result in cornice collapse which could be enough to trigger small to medium-sized avalanches. Anyone heading into the fells at the moment should have a full set of good waterproofs if they want to remain cheerful. Warmth layers, including spare woolly hats and waterproof gloves are essential, as is a map and compass, and a headtorch.

The snowline today was at around 350m, and with ice on paths from that height upwards, care was needed by all. Today the assessor wore crampons from about 450m on the way up to Red Tarn, right down to just above Greenside at the end of his walk, and today considered them essential for safe walking in the mountains. The snow has continued to drift onto south-facing slopes, and is currently at a maximum depth of 70cm, although this is the exception, with most drifts being between 30cm - 50cm. Today there was very little wind, so the snow was not moving about as much as yesterday. Visibility was still very poor above the cloud base (about 650m), being reduced in places to just 10m, however, as there wasn't much wind, the spindrift that made things so difficult yesterday wasn't present today, so at least the snow goggles could stay in the rucksack. On Striding and Swirral Edges the path is consolidated by hundreds of passing feet, and rocks above 750m were covered in rime ice. The exits from both ridges onto the summit plateau were very steep banks of snow, which is a little more stable than it was yesterday. An ice axe and crampons are essential here, as a slip in either location will result into a long, dangerous slide of up to 1000ft over rocks. Descending either ridge on your bum is a sure way to quickly get out of control - if you haven't got the correct equipment (ice axe and crampons) and skills to use them, a much safer descent towards Glenridding is to head north over Lower Man and Whiteside, then walk down the Keppel Cove zigzags. Many of the climbs above Red Tarn and on Brown Cove Crags came into climbable condition for the first time this winter today. Due to poor visibility, the assessor couldn't see which lines where being climbed, but could hear lots of teams enjoying the good ice and snow. Please note that the forecast for tomorrow is for a thaw and rain at all levels, so these climbs may well become unpleasant to climb tomorrow. There is of course, a good chance that you'll damage this rare habitat if you climb there in less than perfect conditions, so have a look by all means, but please back off if the climbs aren't in tomorrow. Full winter clothing and equipment are essential for safe walking in the hills at present. Today it was great to see so many people taking and following compass bearings to find the correct ways off the summit plateau.

The snow level is around 350m, although it is a light covering at that height, but does get deeper above 500m. As the wind direction has swung from the south-westerlies of the last few days to a northerly today, there is a lot of snow movement, with windslab now building on south-facing slopes, and crossloading anywhere where the snow is increasing in depth. On a south-facing slope (overlook Red Tarn on the flanks of Swirral Edge) at 800m today the snowpack was made up of semi-frozen turf covered by 25-30cm of soft, dry snow. On top of this was a harder 10cm layer of icy, granular snow, with a further 20cm of hard-packed windslab on top of that, giving a total snow depth of around 60cm. This windslab has a hard crust, strong enough to support bodyweight in places, but largely collapsing with each step. These layers are not bonded well together, and currently present a considerable avalanche hazard on this aspect. On east-facing slopes there is some windslab, but much of this has been shifted by the wind. However, there is still some instablity on these faces. Small cornices are present on NE through to S facing slopes. On other aspects, and anywhere that is, or recently has been, exposed to the wind, the ground is scoured in places, and the snow depth is minimal. Striding Edge and Swirral Edge were in good condition today, but the exits from both ridges consist of steep banks of unstable snow. At the exits to both there are also cornices close-by, so extreme care was needed today to navigate accurately if trying to descend either of these ridges. Visibility during the morning was zero above 850m, and with stinging spindrift being hurled across the summit plateau, goggles were essential in these whiteout conditions. All of this gave difficult navigation challenges, and the accurate use of a map and compass was essential - this is not a good place to try navigating with an electronic device. Fortunately, many people were turning back from Red Tarn today - a good mountaineering decision given the circumstances. Climbing conditions are improving, with some of the gullies now starting to build with snow and ice, but they are still very thin. Turf above 750m was frozen at 5cm depth in places, but was soggy in others, so careful route choice, and the sense to not want to damage a rare alpine floral habitat were called for. Upland tarns, including Red Tarn, and partially frozen, but obviously not safe to walk upon. It goes without saying that full winter clothing and equipment are essential in the conditions described above. On days like these no walk above the snowline can be described as fellwalking - in full winter conditions this is winter mountaineering, even if you choose to take one of the regular summer walking routes. Come properly equipped and you'll not only have a great time, but you'll stand a good chance of not becoming a mountain rescue statistic. Have fun, but take care out there folks!"

Considerable amounts of soft slab have been deposited on lee slopes. Strding and Swirral Edges were buried under a considerable amount of soft snow. The exits from both ridges were waist deep, steep banks of unconsolidated snow overlying a harder layer. The easier paths on the southern side of Swirral Edge were completely banked out meaning progress was easier on the crest of the ridge.

This snow is soft, and moves alarmingly when you walk on it. On the exits from both ridges you will need to take care, and don't be afraid to turn around if you get to the headwall and think it is unjustifiable. Interestingly, the windspeed on the summit plateau today was much less than on the col between Lower Man and Whiteside. Here on the col, the windspeed was gusting 37mph, giving a windchill of -13.2C! There are no winter climbs in condition in the Lake District at present. Please refrain from trying to find bits of ice or frozen turf to climb - all you will do is damage rare alpine flora, and may well cause damage to yourself or others, as all those spikes and boulders we use for belays when they are frozen in are currently loose and not suitable as anchors. With colder conditions set to return from mid-week, winter clothing and equipment should be carried by all going into the fells at present. Right now the high fells are great to explore, so pack your rucksack and head for the heights!"

There is still some ice on paths where it has become compacted, but for the most part last night's thaw, which continued throughout today, has depleted much of the snow and ice that has been present over the last couple of days. On the paths, above 550m, where snow and ice remains, it is still hard and treacherous, making for very difficult walking conditions. This includes the paths on both Striding Edge and Swirral Edge. On Striding Edge today the rock was largely wet and slippery, with patches of slushy ice. The headwall leading onto the summit plateau was soft, slowly thawing snow to a depth of around 20cm, which in places had an ominous hollow sound to it as you kicked in your boot. This could potentially lead to a slide onto rocky and dangerous ground, so great care is needed here. On Swirral Edge the remaining snow and ice was firmer, but also very slippery. The bank of snow at the top of the ridge was very icy in places, also requiring great care. These conditions for walkers are extremely hazardous. Everything feels insecure underfoot, and with more rock showing than ice, crampons are often felt to not be needed in such terrain. There is no easy answer, other than to take your time, and take care, or to turn back if you find it is more hazardous than you hoped. With today's thaw it was surprising to see climbers in the gullies and on the buttresses above Red Tarn. These climbs couldn't have possibly have been in good condition, and given the well-forecasted thaw, it was a shame to see so many people ignoring the advice given in the BMC's White Guide for climbers, which asks climbers not to climb in these areas when the turf isn't fully frozen as this damages a delicate habitat for rare alpine plants. If you missed the small window of frozen conditions over the last couple of days, there will be others this winter. Please wait until the frozen ground returns. Even with warmer conditions full winter clothing and equipment should be carried in the high fells. This includes an ice axe and crampons, as a slight drop in temperature will soon turn everything to solid ice again."

Our reports will go live daily from today through until the end of Easter. Today there was some ice on paths at all levels, but this could largely be avoided up to around 650m. Above that height spikes were useful on easy, flat paths, but for any gradients crampons were needed. There is not a huge amount of snow on the fells of the Lake District at present, but that which is laying is on sheltered slopes, such as at the top of both Striding Edge and Swirral Edge. On the exits from these ridges the snow has banked out to give a thin layer (about 2cm) of windslab (wind-driven, hard snow on the surface), with graupel (hail) and dry powder beneath to a maximum depth of around 25cm. This is unstable, but currently not sufficient to pose any serious problems. On Helvellyn summit plateau the western-facing slopes are scoured of snow, but the ground surface is hard and icy. On the east-facing slopes you will find banks of snow, as above. There is a small cornice above Red Tarn, and there are crack lines appearing where this has already slumped slightly. Heading round towards Nethermost Pike the cornice above Lad Crag (which holds Nethermost Gully) is larger, and also slumping slightly. Today was a good day for winter climbers. Although the gullies haven't yet filled with snow, in some of the higher gullies (Catstycam Gully was climbed by the assessor today) there is currently thin but solid runnels of water-ice lower down, with good neve higher up. The turf in Catstycam Gully was frozen today, and it was good to see climbing teams in Number 1 and Number 2 Gullies as well as on some of the buttress routes above Red Tarn. However, the forecast is for milder conditions over the next few days, with temperatures at summit level hovering around zero to +2C. This could well mean that we will lose some of the ice, and that the turf will thaw. Please don't climb in the these sensitive areas if the turf isn't fully frozen. Walkers heading above the snowline will need full winter clothing, map and compass, a headtorch, and an ice axe and crampons. The assessor needed axe and crampons to make the traverse of Swirral and Striding Edges today. Let's hope that tomorrow is another great day in the fells, and that the slight thaw won't be too detrimental to the ice and frozen turf for the climbers. Some more snow, so the skiers can have some fun, would be nice too!"

The patches of windslab noted in the previous few days are now reasonably consolidated and stable. There was a slight crust but this was generally non weight baring where it had been exposed to the sun. The lack of wind also meant that surface hoar crystals are beginning to form on the snow on shady north facing slopes. The snow level is between 400m & 600m depending on the amount of sunlight the slope has received ie a lower altitude on northerly aspects. Striding and Swirral Edges are in full winter condition and an ice axe and crampons are essential for anyone attempting them. The exit to Striding Edge is sporting a large cornice (snow overhang) This is easier on the left but still a significant obstacle above a large drop which must be overcome to reach the plateau. Swirral Edge is holding more snow and is almost totally buried with the easiest route being along the exposed snow crest. The cornices which have formed above the Red Tarn bowl now project some 5m-6m out into space. They are at their most unstable when the air temperature is above freezing, as it was today, so please give them a wide berth and advise others with less experience to do likewise.

The summit plateau was not inspected today, however with gale-force southwesterly winds overnight and throughout the day, it would have been well scoured with large areas of very hard névé, verglas (ice), and frozen ground across the tops. Many windward (southwest facing) slopes in both Red Tarn Cove and Brown Cove also had large areas of exposed hard névé, and for anyone traveling on even moderately steep ground, runouts are considerable if one was to slip and fall. Windslab is also present on top of névé, especially on lee slopes, but also in some areas even on more scoured ground.

It was plus 2 degrees C and raining on the summit just after midday. The thaw is especially rapid below 750m where the remaining snow lies in sheltered spots and on paths where it has been compacted – thus taking longer to thaw. Mostly below 800m it was slush on paths, but there were patches of ice – often resembling slush - so care needs to be taken. The majority of the snow now lies above 850m on predominantly north and east facing aspects where drifts deep enough to swallow a 60cm ice axe remain, although such depth is exceptional. On windblown aspects, such as large parts of the summit plateau, there is little or no snow at all. The snowpack was saturated, heavy and thawing. There are cornices on the edges of north and east facing aspects. Although small they are very unstable, so please keep well away from such edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise. Cumbria is currently under a Met Office Yellow warning for rain until 6am on Saturday – when a Met Office Yellow warning for the strength of the wind commences! If the precipitation continues to fall as rain on the summits, then walkers out on Saturday could encounter less snow than described today; conversely, it would only take a marginal drop in temperature for snow to fall and, with the ground being saturated, ice to reform. Thus walkers out on the high fells on Saturday should be prepared for all eventualities. Full winter clothing (waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves), footwear and equipment are essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells. For those going above the snowline and attempting exposed routes, or climbing or traversing steep ground, an ice axe remains essential and crampons must be carried in case ice is encountered. Indeed, it is highly recommended to take crampons, or micro spikes, even if traversing easier angled terrain as for the majority of this week the flat summit plateau has been covered in ice. This was not the case today but with the ground being saturated a slight drop in temperature would see it reform and this, combined with the forecasted high winds, makes staying upright difficult.

Thus fell walkers out on Thursday could encounter less snow than experienced today – or more snow if it is colder than currently predicted! The snow depth rises with height to reach a very approximate average of 6cm at 900m. However, in reality this doesn’t mean much as the actual depth varies enormously from virtually nothing on windblown aspects, such as large parts of the summit plateau, to drifts deep enough to swallow a 60cm ice axe – although that’s the exception.

Above 850m on east and north facing slopes, recent soft snow and windslab lies above the patches of old, hard, icy snow that has been present for several weeks and these 2 layers have not bonded. Care needs to be taken negotiating such slopes – such as the exits to both Striding and Swirral Edges. The summit plateau was covered in ice and its rocks plastered in rime ice. This made walking in the strong wind, which was blowing towards the edge, more treacherous. Cornices have formed on the edges of north and east facing aspects.

The greatest accumulations of snow are to be found on the steep ground on corrie headwalls and rims with generally north through east-facing aspects above 750m. All of the snow has undergone a deep thaw in the last 24hrs and was very well frozen today. The wind made it too dangerous to inspect the ridges properly, but it is likely that there are still large areas of unavoidable snow on both Swirral and Striding edge.

The readings today were taken from Red Tarn and it should be noted that although the windspeeds recorded were fresh to moderate, frequent squalls were experienced which were estimated to be in the region of 40-50mph. This would almost certainly have been higher over the summits. Due to the winds eddying around in the corrie, the wind direction was not a true representation of the actual wind direction and was therefore not recorded. The temperature at 700m was + 1.8°C and using a saturated air lapse rate (subtract 0.5°C per 100m altitude), the temperature on the summit of Helvellyn is estimated to have been hovering around freezing.

However the unavoidable bank of steep snow at the top of Striding Edge was frozen hard and extremely sketchy for those without the right equipment.

Although only a short section, now with deep steps cut into it, it is not a place to slip so for anyone attempting this classic route, an ice axe remains essential and crampons or microspikes recommended. Conversely, the snow on Swirral’s exit can almost be avoided. Paths were mainly dry with isolated patches of ice – but these were thawing as temperatures rose. Weather wise, the main feature was the gusty nature of the strengthening wind, which caused many walkers to sensibly turn back. This is due to get far worse over the weekend with the Lake District currently under a Met Office yellow warning for the strength of the wind from midday on Saturday until midnight on Sunday – yes 36 hours! Again, walkers out over the weekend should be prepared to turn back, or plan a lower level walk or stay in the pub and watch the rugby!!

After a dry morning, rain began to push into the region from around midday. Although it was thawing at all levels today, the temperature was only just above freezing on the top of Helvellyn. The summit plateau is well scoured from strong winds over the previous few days, however, there are still some large drifts of snow in sheltered dips and hollows and ice is also present over relatively large areas. Small cornices have been building around corrie rims which will be unstable in milder conditions and should be given a wide berth. The largest accumulations of snow can be found on north through east-facing aspects above 750m. Drifts in these locations are up to 50 cm in depth. Swirral edge had a good cover of snow over its entire length today and although Striding edge has less snow over its crest, it is still very wintery. The forecast over the next few days is for freezing conditions in the fells which means that any remaining (currently wet) snow and ice will refreeze and consolidate. In these conditions, full winter clothing and equipment including ice axe and crampons are essential for anyone venturing into the higher fells.

The strong winds have re-distributed the fresh snow that has fallen in the last 24 hrs leaving exposed south-western slopes fairly scoured, although with some drifting in sheltered dips and hollows. The summit plateau is very icy in places and cornices were seen building around corrie rims, and will continue to do so in the coming days. The deepest accumulations of snow are to be found on the opposite north through east-facing aspects, where drifts of up 50-60 cm can be found above roughly 700m. Swirral edge has a good cover of generally loose unconsolidated snow along its entire length with patches of firmer windslab encountered towards the top. Striding edge looked very similar from a distance, however, reports from other walkers were suggesting that less snow was present along its crest due to its more exposed position. The northern flanks of Striding edge will, therefore, hold similar deep accumulations. To make a safe descent we dropped into Brown Cove from the col between Lower Man and Whiteside. The winds along here were strong enough to knock us off our feet a few times and estimated in the region of 60-70mph which was significantly higher than the day's recordings. For the climbers out there, the turf is still unfrozen right up to summit level and snow is generally loose and unconsolidated.

As the assessor left the hill, it was snowing/hailing above 650m and raining below 550m with a mixture of the two between those heights! Thus walkers heading for the high fells on Wednesday should expect to encounter more snow than experienced today. The snow has, and is, being deposited on strong, predominantly SSW winds so although the average depth at 900m is only around 5cm the actual depth varies from virtually nothing on windswept areas to exceptional drifts of 60cm. The greatest depths are to be found on N and E facing aspects and in sheltered spots and hollows. The snowpack was very soft, often consisting of hail or spindrift. Indeed with the low cloud it was difficult to ascertain whether you were being bombarded with fresh hail or spindrift!! The only ice encountered today was on the summit plateau – which was covered in verglas (thin ice) and rime ice – and at the top of Swirral Edge. The edges themselves were just covered in the soft snow – which may, or may not, be soft on Wednesday. Full winter clothing (waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves), footwear and equipment are all essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells. For those going above the snowline an ice axe is essential and crampons should be carried in case ice is encountered. Given the amount of ice on the summit plateau today, this is the case even if the so called “easier” routes are planned as walking on the relatively flat summit without such equipment today would not have been easy, enjoyable or safe given the strength of the wind. With the biting hail/spindrift today, goggles are also highly recommended. With more snow falling at altitude and obscuring landmarks, excellent navigational skills are also required – especially when low cloud and deep snow combine. Climbers – Apart from on the summit plateau, the turf remains unfrozen and the snowpack is very soft so please avoid climbing in these conditions to avoid damaging our fragile upland environment.

This was being moved about on strong SW winds and there was more coverage on slopes with a N through E aspect. Goggles were very useful to navigate and move while being pounded by icy spindrift. The old consolidated snow at the top of Swirral Edge was soft and it was easy enough to kick secure steps with a good pair of winter boots. The Helvellyn plateau was a mixture of boot deep snow drifts and rime ice. Wind speeds increased rapidly throughout the day with gusts of 64mph observed on the summit and 70mph+ during our descent of Swirral Edge. Very heavy rain arrived in late afternoon which will potentially be falling as snow down to 500m throughout the night. Full winter clothing & equipment including an ice axe and crampons will be required by anyone heading up into the hills tomorrow.

The winds in particular were very gusty ranging from a dead calm to gale force in a few seconds and some impressive water spouts were observed on Red Tarn. The assessor recorded a peak wind speed of 64.4mph on Swirral Edge but ferocious gusts lower on the mountain were enough to knock walkers off their feet with an estimated speed of 80mph plus. The fresh snow from the past few days has rapidly thawed and the fells are now extensively clear of snow up to summit level. There are still a few small patches of neve (refrozen snow) which remain from Decembers snowfall but the only area of concern for walkers when the winds relent will be the unavoidable patch at the top of Swirral Edge. This will have been wet and soft today but is forecast to freeze overnight with the freezing level lowering to 700m. The combination of snowmelt and rainfall means that streams and rivers are in spate with localised flooding. The stream crossing on the main path from Greenside to Red Tarn was passable with care but any water hazard should be treated with a great deal of caution. Despite the unseasonably warm temperatures full winter clothing and multiple pairs of dry gloves were required to summit safely today.

The deepest drift encountered today was 50cm but that was definitely the exception and easily avoidable. The snowpack was soft with an icy crust that did not bear human weight (especially following the festive over-eating season!). Paths, especially in the morning above 450m, were icy and it was easier walking on the non-compacted snow. The same was true on the summit plateau where exposed ground and rocks were covered in verglas (thin ice) and rime ice.

However the freezing level quickly rose to 700m this morning and the snow level is now around 400m. The snow fell on light NE winds and there is very little increase in depth with height apart from where it has drifted. Generally the snow was a couple of inches deep increasing to calf deep on south through west aspects and in sheltered hollows. Above 700m a non weight bearing rain crust has formed on the new snow where a band of freezing rain passed through. This has also plastered any exposed rock in verglas (black ice) and produced some impressive rime ice formations on exposed turf. Striding & Swirral Edge are coated in verglas and unhelpful new snow. There are also patches of hidden neve (refrozen old snow), in particular an unavoidable patch at the top of Swirral Edge. These tricky conditions mean that crampons and an ice axe were essential for safe passage today. The unusual wind direction means that the Helvellyn plateau is holding plenty of drifted snow. This combined with the large areas of verglas and rime ice mean that anyone venturing onto the high fells would be wise to carry ice axe and crampons even on the easiest routes. The summit windchill was -12 degrees and visibility at times was less than 20m so walkers should be fully equipped for winter conditions with plenty of warm and waterproof layers and the ability to safely navigate their chosen route. Climbers - Despite appearances the turf is unfrozen right up to summit level. Exposed areas now have a covering of rime but beneath this thin layer the turf is totally unprotected. The new snow pack is thin and soft with a slight crust.

Conversely, in sheltered, shaded areas there were patches of ice on paths and verglas (thin ice) on rocks – the latter sometimes difficult to spot, so care needs to be taken. With milder temperatures, though, areas not catching the sun were more likely today to be wet rather than icy but this could easily change again with a slight drop in temperature. Despite the milder temperatures, the summit windchill remains below freezing so full winter clothing (waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves), footwear and equipment are all essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells.

The patches of windslab noted in the previous few days are now reasonably consolidated and stable. There was a slight crust but this was generally non weight baring where it had been exposed to the sun. The lack of wind also meant that surface hoar crystals are beginning to form on the snow on shady north facing slopes.

The summit plateau was not inspected today, however with gale-force southwesterly winds overnight and throughout the day, it would have been well scoured with large areas of very hard névé, verglas (ice), and frozen ground across the tops. Many windward (southwest facing) slopes in both Red Tarn Cove and Brown Cove also had large areas of exposed hard névé, and for anyone traveling on even moderately steep ground, runouts are considerable if one was to slip and fall. Windslab is also present on top of névé, especially on lee slopes, but also in some areas even on more scoured ground.

It was generally soft and unconsolidated until above 750m where there were areas of neve (refrozen snow) and ice to contend with. Westerly aspects and the plateau were being scoured by the wind but the strong gusty conditions were preventing any significant depositions on lee slopes. Striding & Swirral Edge are both in full winter condition meaning that winter boots, an ice axe and crampons are essential for a safe ascent and descent. A number of crag fast and ill equipped walkers needed rescuing today having underestimated the conditions. Additionally there were sudden big changes in wind speed and direction as the squalls blew through and at least one walker was blown off Swirral Edge, luckily without serious injury. Goggles were essential for any semblance of enjoyment on the hills today. Cornices were slowly building on N through E to S aspects and are currently very unstable so give them a wide berth. Exposed terrain above 850m was beginning to freeze but generally the turf was soggy and the rocks un-rimed.

It was plus 2 degrees C and raining on the summit just after midday. The thaw is especially rapid below 750m where the remaining snow lies in sheltered spots and on paths where it has been compacted – thus taking longer to thaw. Mostly below 800m it was slush on paths, but there were patches of ice – often resembling slush - so care needs to be taken. The majority of the snow now lies above 850m on predominantly north and east facing aspects where drifts deep enough to swallow a 60cm ice axe remain, although such depth is exceptional. On windblown aspects, such as large parts of the summit plateau, there is little or no snow at all. The snowpack was saturated, heavy and thawing. There are cornices on the edges of north and east facing aspects. Although small they are very unstable, so please keep well away from such edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise. Cumbria is currently under a Met Office Yellow warning for rain until 6am on Saturday – when a Met Office Yellow warning for the strength of the wind commences! If the precipitation continues to fall as rain on the summits, then walkers out on Saturday could encounter less snow than described today; conversely, it would only take a marginal drop in temperature for snow to fall and, with the ground being saturated, ice to reform. Thus walkers out on the high fells on Saturday should be prepared for all eventualities. Full winter clothing (waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves), footwear and equipment are essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells. For those going above the snowline and attempting exposed routes, or climbing or traversing steep ground, an ice axe remains essential and crampons must be carried in case ice is encountered. Indeed, it is highly recommended to take crampons, or micro spikes, even if traversing easier angled terrain as for the majority of this week the flat summit plateau has been covered in ice. This was not the case today but with the ground being saturated a slight drop in temperature would see it reform and this, combined with the forecasted high winds, makes staying upright difficult. Alternatively, simply plan a lower level walk or visit the numerous waterfalls which are spectacular!!

Above Red Tarn (700m) the new snow was being moved around on strong westerly winds and was being deposited as soft slab in sheltered hollows and on N through E to S aspects. It was generally boot deep with drifts to knee height. In places this new snow was overlying the older consolidated snowpack which was everything from a soft sugary consistency to bullet hard ice today. Striding and Swirral Edge are both in full winter condition and the tricky and wide variety of conditions underfoot mean that crampons and ice axe are essential for anyone venturing onto any steep and exposed terrain.

Above 850m on east and north facing slopes, recent soft snow and windslab lies above the patches of old, hard, icy snow that has been present for several weeks and these 2 layers have not bonded. Care needs to be taken negotiating such slopes – such as the exits to both Striding and Swirral Edges. The summit plateau was covered in ice and its rocks plastered in rime ice. This made walking in the strong wind, which was blowing towards the edge, more treacherous. Cornices have formed on the edges of north and east facing aspects.

Much of the western side of Helvellyn up to and including the summit is largely snow-free, however, there are still fragmented patches of snow on the paths above roughly 750m.

The greatest accumulations of snow are to be found on the steep ground on corrie headwalls and rims with generally north through east-facing aspects above 750m. All of the snow has undergone a deep thaw in the last 24hrs and was very well frozen today. The wind made it too dangerous to inspect the ridges properly, but it is likely that there are still large areas of unavoidable snow on both Swirral and Striding edge. As such, Ice axe and crampons are essential for anyone travelling these routes in the next few days.

The readings today were taken from Red Tarn and it should be noted that although the windspeeds recorded were fresh to moderate, frequent squalls were experienced which were estimated to be in the region of 40-50mph. This would almost certainly have been higher over the summits. Due to the winds eddying around in the corrie, the wind direction was not a true representation of the actual wind direction and was therefore not recorded. The temperature at 700m was + 1.8°C and using a saturated air lapse rate (subtract 0.5°C per 100m altitude), the temperature on the summit of Helvellyn is estimated to have been hovering around freezing.

Conversely, the snow on Swirral’s exit can almost be avoided. Paths were mainly dry with isolated patches of ice – but these were thawing as temperatures rose. Weather wise, the main feature was the gusty nature of the strengthening wind, which caused many walkers to sensibly turn back.

The strong winds have re-distributed the fresh snow that has fallen in the last 24 hrs leaving exposed south-western slopes fairly scoured, although with some drifting in sheltered dips and hollows. The summit plateau is very icy in places and cornices were seen building around corrie rims, and will continue to do so in the coming days. The deepest accumulations of snow are to be found on the opposite north through east-facing aspects, where drifts of up 50-60 cm can be found above roughly 700m. Swirral edge has a good cover of generally loose unconsolidated snow along its entire length with patches of firmer windslab encountered towards the top. Striding edge looked very similar from a distance, however, reports from other walkers were suggesting that less snow was present along its crest due to its more exposed position. The northern flanks of Striding edge will, therefore, hold similar deep accumulations. To make a safe descent we dropped into Brown Cove from the col between Lower Man and Whiteside. The winds along here were strong enough to knock us off our feet a few times and estimated in the region of 60-70mph which was significantly higher than the day's recordings. For the climbers out there, the turf is still unfrozen right up to summit level and snow is generally loose and unconsolidated.

As the assessor left the hill, it was snowing/hailing above 650m and raining below 550m with a mixture of the two between those heights! Thus walkers heading for the high fells on Wednesday should expect to encounter more snow than experienced today. The snow has, and is, being deposited on strong, predominantly SSW winds so although the average depth at 900m is only around 5cm the actual depth varies from virtually nothing on windswept areas to exceptional drifts of 60cm. The greatest depths are to be found on N and E facing aspects and in sheltered spots and hollows. The snowpack was very soft, often consisting of hail or spindrift. Indeed with the low cloud it was difficult to ascertain whether you were being bombarded with fresh hail or spindrift!! The only ice encountered today was on the summit plateau – which was covered in verglas (thin ice) and rime ice – and at the top of Swirral Edge. The edges themselves were just covered in the soft snow – which may, or may not, be soft on Wednesday. Full winter clothing (waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves), footwear and equipment are all essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells. For those going above the snowline an ice axe is essential and crampons should be carried in case ice is encountered. Given the amount of ice on the summit plateau today, this is the case even if the so called “easier” routes are planned as walking on the relatively flat summit without such equipment today would not have been easy, enjoyable or safe given the strength of the wind. With the biting hail/spindrift today, goggles are also highly recommended. With more snow falling at altitude and obscuring landmarks, excellent navigational skills are also required – especially when low cloud and deep snow combine. Climbers – Apart from on the summit plateau, the turf remains unfrozen and the snowpack is very soft so please avoid climbing in these conditions to avoid damaging our fragile upland environment.

Both Striding & Swirral Edges had a good covering of soft snow with rime ice forming on exposed rocks above 850m. This was being moved about on strong SW winds and there was more coverage on slopes with a N through E aspect. Goggles were very useful to navigate and move while being pounded by icy spindrift. The old consolidated snow at the top of Swirral Edge was soft and it was easy enough to kick secure steps with a good pair of winter boots. The Helvellyn plateau was a mixture of boot deep snow drifts and rime ice. Wind speeds increased rapidly throughout the day with gusts of 64mph observed on the summit and 70mph+ during our descent of Swirral Edge. Very heavy rain arrived in late afternoon which will potentially be falling as snow down to 500m throughout the night. Full winter clothing & equipment including an ice axe and crampons will be required by anyone heading up into the hills tomorrow. Navigation is likely to be very tricky with the potential for avalanches and with the high winds picking up the new snow and crating whiteout conditions.

The winds in particular were very gusty ranging from a dead calm to gale force in a few seconds and some impressive water spouts were observed on Red Tarn. The assessor recorded a peak wind speed of 64.4mph on Swirral Edge but ferocious gusts lower on the mountain were enough to knock walkers off their feet with an estimated speed of 80mph plus. The fresh snow from the past few days has rapidly thawed and the fells are now extensively clear of snow up to summit level. There are still a few small patches of neve (refrozen snow) which remain from Decembers snowfall but the only area of concern for walkers when the winds relent will be the unavoidable patch at the top of Swirral Edge. This will have been wet and soft today but is forecast to freeze overnight with the freezing level lowering to 700m. The combination of snowmelt and rainfall means that streams and rivers are in spate with localised flooding. The stream crossing on the main path from Greenside to Red Tarn was passable with care but any water hazard should be treated with a great deal of caution. Despite the unseasonably warm temperatures full winter clothing and multiple pairs of dry gloves were required to summit safely today.

The snow was deposited on fairly light winds, so unusually there is little increase in depth with height and a relatively uniform average depth of around 4cm. The deepest drift encountered today was 50cm but that was definitely the exception and easily avoidable. The snowpack was soft with an icy crust that did not bear human weight (especially following the festive over-eating season!). Paths, especially in the morning above 450m, were icy and it was easier walking on the non-compacted snow. The same was true on the summit plateau where exposed ground and rocks were covered in verglas (thin ice) and rime ice. Striding and Swirral Edges were both covered in the thin layer of snow although with far less of the verglas experienced on Thursday. The exception to this was on their exits.

However the freezing level quickly rose to 700m this morning and the snow level is now around 400m. The snow fell on light NE winds and there is very little increase in depth with height apart from where it has drifted. Generally the snow was a couple of inches deep increasing to calf deep on south through west aspects and in sheltered hollows. Above 700m a non weight bearing rain crust has formed on the new snow where a band of freezing rain passed through. This has also plastered any exposed rock in verglas (black ice) and produced some impressive rime ice formations on exposed turf. Striding & Swirral Edge are coated in verglas and unhelpful new snow. There are also patches of hidden neve (refrozen old snow), in particular an unavoidable patch at the top of Swirral Edge. These tricky conditions mean that crampons and an ice axe were essential for safe passage today. The unusual wind direction means that the Helvellyn plateau is holding plenty of drifted snow. This combined with the large areas of verglas and rime ice mean that anyone venturing onto the high fells would be wise to carry ice axe and crampons even on the easiest routes. The summit windchill was -12 degrees and visibility at times was less than 20m so walkers should be fully equipped for winter conditions with plenty of warm and waterproof layers and the ability to safely navigate their chosen route. Climbers - Despite appearances the turf is unfrozen right up to summit level. Exposed areas now have a covering of rime but beneath this thin layer the turf is totally unprotected. The new snow pack is thin and soft with a slight crust.

The bad news, for those who relish winter conditions, is that the Lake District paths are not only free from unavoidable snow but also largely dry where they are, or have been, exposed to either the sun and or the wind. Conversely, in sheltered, shaded areas there were patches of ice on paths and verglas (thin ice) on rocks – the latter sometimes difficult to spot, so care needs to be taken. With milder temperatures, though, areas not catching the sun were more likely today to be wet rather than icy but this could easily change again with a slight drop in temperature. Despite the milder temperatures, the summit windchill remains below freezing so full winter clothing (waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves), footwear and equipment are all essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells. This is not just for safety, but also for enjoyment as the summit today was a place to don extra clothing and linger to enjoy the spectacular 360 degrees of awesomeness (if that’s a word!!). In addition, there was hardly anyone else out enjoying it so come properly equipped to enjoy these magnificent conditions without the crowds!!"

These are incredibly slippery with the potential for a long and very serious slide. Crampons are needed to safely venture into these areas, however this should only become an issue away from the popular routes and paths Swirral Edge was in tricky condition consisting of wet rock, rime ice and verglas but was passable with care.

Tuesday’s turbo thaw had halted this morning owing to a combination of an overnight frost at altitude and the height and location of the remaining snow.

Summit temperatures are once again below freezing with rime ice forming down to 800m and Red Tarn was almost fully frozen. The vast majority of the Lake District fells are now clear of snow but the rime ice and a few areas of verglas on the summits mean that conditions underfoot remain tricky and microspikes were very useful today. With careful route choice Striding and Swirral Edges can now both be climbed without setting foot on snow although there is still rime and verglas to contend with. However it's essential for anyone who does venture onto the few remaining patches of snow to be fully kitted out with an ice axe and crampons as it has now refrozen and the surface is bullet hard and icy. This hazard is generally to be found above 850m in sheltered spots and hollows and on predominantly steep north and east facing aspects. Despite the spring like conditions in the valleys and the lack of snow, winter is still very much in evidence on the fells and walkers should go equipped with plenty of warm and waterproof layers, hats & gloves, a reliable method of navigating, food & fluid and some emergency kit including a survival bag, whistle and headtorch.

We would like to remind everyone that Government guidance stipulates that people should only exercise locally, not leaving the village, town or city where they live. Ground conditions today were extremely similar to Tuesday owing to another overnight temperature inversion combined today with a cloud inversion. It was minus 3 degrees in a cloudy Glenridding this morning and plus 6 degrees on a sunny summit a couple of hours later. The result of which meant that there were patches of frost and some ice on paths lower down – especially on drainage lines - but none on higher elevations. This valley frost and ice had thawed by the afternoon. However, walkers out on Thursday should expect, and be prepared to encounter, a return to patches of ice and possibly frost in shady and sheltered spots at altitude. The overnight temperature inversion also meant that there was a continuing thaw of the remaining snow albeit at a snail’s pace. The thaw is so slow since the remaining snow lies in patches above 850m (with the majority above 900m), in sheltered spots and hollows and on predominantly steep north and east facing aspects. The snowpack was generally soft and sugary apart from places where it has been compacted. Since it is likely to refreeze overnight, walkers out on Thursday are strongly advised to avoid any snow patches. That stated, the vast majority of the Cumbrian fells and paths are now free from snow. As for the past few days, the only unavoidable, and icy, snow encountered today was at the exit to Swirral Edge. Although it is only a very short section, an ice axe is recommended, especially in descent, as it was hard snow and the footprints in it were similarly icy. Admittedly, you would have to be unlucky to have a serious slide on it, but that’s how accidents occur and, especially at the moment, we all need to strongly err on the side of caution. Conversely with careful route choice, Striding Edge and its exit can now be climbed without setting foot on snow with the normal path up its exit now also almost free from snow. The past 3 days have been the exception with a summit windchill above zero. Walkers out on Thursday should expect, and be prepared for, a return to a more normal sub zero summit windchill so full winter clothing (waterproofs, extra warm layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots and equipment are all essential for anyone going out onto the fells.

We would like to remind everyone that Government guidance stipulates that people should only exercise locally, not leaving the village, town or city where they live. The thaw continues at all levels; once again, although the summit temperature around midday was only just above freezing, the thaw was being accelerated by driving rain and drizzle. As this was accompanied with a predominantly S to SW wind it was noticeable that slopes facing these directions are thawing faster than other aspects (plus E and N facing slopes had deeper drifts to begin with). The snowline has now risen to around 750m although up to 850m large areas of the fells are now free from snow. Above 850m a significant amount of snow remains. The snowpack was mainly soft and wet with patches of hard snow and ice. Drifts of up to 100cm still exist, although such depth is the exception. More commonly above 850cm the snow drifts in sheltered spots and hollows are between 10cm and 15cm. There are also patches of hard ice on paths; although these can be found as low as 350m, the majority now lie above 600m and are mainly situated on flatter sections, where paths are crossed by drainage lines and, especially above 700m, on popular routes where snow has been compacted. During this transitional phase some paths had sections of slush literally adjacent to sections of hard, slippery ice creating treacherous conditions. With deep snow still obscuring/obliterating landmarks, conditions above the snowline can change quickly and dramatically when showers blow through, particularly if these are in the form of snow – which is currently forecast at altitude on Wednesday. Excellent navigational skills are essential as is a safe back-up escape plan to ensure that you do not get caught out in a whiteout somewhere where you do not want to be. There are cornices above, predominantly but not exclusively, N and E facing slopes. With the thaw these have slumped, weakened and,, presumably (I didn’t go too close!) now consist of soft snow. Therefore, although reduced in size, they are unstable, so please keep well clear of such edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise. Upland tarns, such as Red Tarn, remain frozen although with the milder temperatures are unsafe to venture onto. Despite the milder temperatures, the summit windchill remains well below freezing so full winter clothing (waterproofs, extra warm layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots and equipment are all essential for anyone going out onto the fells. For those venturing above the snowline an ice axe and crampons remain essential; this is despite the snowpack being mainly wet owing to the amount of hard snow and ice that still exists and the fact that it would only take a marginal drop in temperature (currently forecast on Wednesday) for the snow to harden.

There is currently a dramatic contrast between the cold, green valleys and the alpine conditions above the snowline which is between 400m and 450m. Below this height many paths were dry although there were patches of ice at all levels, especially on flatter sections or where paths cross drainage lines. Above 450m, snow depth rapidly increases with height with all aspects holding a significant amount of snow; even the summit plateau had an average of between 30cm to 40cm and above 850m the deepest drifts are now over 100cm. The snowpack continues to consolidate although difficulties encountered moving over it varies. Where there is either a weight baring crust or the snow has been compacted, it is relatively easy (with crampons); however it is both energy sapping and time consuming when either a non-weight baring crust or soft snow is encountered. Route planning must take this into consideration. Several snow showers were marginally adding to existing accumulations and, with Cumbria under a Met Office yellow warning for snow until midnight on Wednesday, walkers out on Wednesday should expect to encounter more snow and spindrift – especially to the E of the Park.

With a daytime summit temperature just above freezing, there was a slow thaw although this was only really noticeable below 500m and especially below 400m. The main snowline is now around 350m. Depth increases markedly with altitude to reach an unusual 50cm on the summit plateau itself with drifts of over 100cm. The snowpack was soft at all levels and increasingly wet with decreased elevation. Breaking trail through the snowpack is energy sapping and even following footprints was heavy going. Excellent navigation is required as the deep snow obscures landmarks (including cairns), paths are completely covered and low cloud creates virtual, or actual, whiteout conditions. Therefore routes above the snowline are far harder physically and progress far slower than normal; factors which must be considered when route planning. The soft and wet snow has also created an extremely unstable snowpack on steep slopes – especially on N and E facing where, above 700m, old hard snow existed prior to the recent snowfall. There are reports of snow sliding down Helvellyn, Catstye Cam and Whiteside. Cornices exist above some N & E facing slopes. Owing to extremely poor visibility it was impossible to either see or inspect them so they could already have collapsed and contributed to the snow that has slid down the slope. If not, they will be extremely unstable, so please keep well clear of such edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise.

We would like to remind everyone that Government guidance stipulates that people should only exercise locally to where they live Heavy snow fell overnight on light winds giving a fairly uniform distribution across most aspects of the Lake District fells. At 300m the snow was soft, wet and approximately boot deep. Depths increased dramatically with altitude with an unusual calf to mid thigh deep snow pack found on the Helvellyn plateau. Paths above 600m were totally drifted in and invisible and this combined with whiteout conditions at times made for very slow going. Progress on foot was taking 2-3 times longer than usual. There was a sudden increase in temperature after the snow and heavy rain fell up to altitudes of 800m producing a striking network of drainage channels on the snows surface but also an unstable snowpack. Striding and Swirral Edges are both buried beneath soft and sticky deep snow with flutings and small cornices evident on the northern side of the ridge. Even on the crest the snow was calf to mid thigh deep and any routes on the flanks were fully buried in unstable deep snow. Any snow knocked off the ridge readily formed snow wheels which rapidly increased in size as they disappeared down into the gloom! The headwall on Striding Edge would have been a very high risk option today and the exit to Swirral was marginal with just enough rocks showing to plot a secure route up. There were multiple wet snow, or possible cornice collapse, avalanches on the Red Tarn face of Helvellyn, Catstycam Gully and in Kepple Cove. These had all occurred on steep and craggy NW - NE aspects with the debris fields extending as low as 500m. Any cornices will be incredibly unstable with summit temperatures above freezing and the additional loading from the new snow. Please give them a very wide berth and advise others with less experience to do likewise. Red Tarn was still frozen with approximately 90% of the ice covered in snow. In poor visibility with the majority of landmarks obscured it would easily be possible to wander onto this hazard. Full winter clothing and equipment are required by anyone venturing onto the fells with goggles also being very useful today. An ice axe and crampons are essential for safe travel in the current very challenging conditions. Just a small drop in temperature will quickly refreeze the snow pack giving very serious and icy conditions at all levels.

We would like to remind everyone that Government guidance stipulates that people should only exercise locally, not leaving the village, town or city where they live. It’s groundhog day with a repetition of Tuesday’s caveat! For those undertaking their local exercise on Thursday, unfortunately this report is probably already out of date as I write it since it was still snowing (raining in the valleys) as I left the hill and yet again Cumbria is currently under another Met Office Yellow warning for snow until 6pm on Thursday. Therefore please expect, and be prepared to encounter, more snow than experienced and described on Wednesday. The following report, though, will give you an idea of what ground any fresh snow will be covering. Fresh snow has settled above c300m deposited on predominantly E winds adding to existing accumulations. The precipitation was falling as rain below c300m. As usual, the depth of the snow that’s fallen over the past 48 hours varies considerably from little on windswept areas to drifts of up to 60cm at 900m in sheltered spots and hollows and on predominantly W facing aspects with a very approximate average being around 8cm at 900m . The consistency of the recent snow also varies from mainly wet below 500m to soft powder above this altitude. Above 700m, especially on E and N facing aspects, there is old, hard snow above which the fresh snow, deposited on E winds, was failing to settle. That was the situation where observation was possible, however owing to extremely poor visibility it was not possible to inspect Helvellyn’s main E face where there is a possibility that an unstable layer of snow could be building on it and other such slopes. A particular hazard on paths, especially on flatter sections or where they cross drainage lines, is fresh snow covering patches of ice. This was also a problem above 700m on popular routes where old compacted snow and ice was hidden. On windswept areas, especially above 800m, large areas of ground were covered by ice. On Monday, small cracks were observed in some of the cornices that exist above N and E facing slopes. Again owing to poor visibility, it was not possible to safely inspect them today but please keep well clear of such edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise. Upland tarns, such as Red Tarn, have frozen and may now be hidden under fresh snow. This combined with slightly milder temperatures makes them extremely dangerous to walk on. Full winter clothing (waterproofs, extra warm layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots and equipment are all essential for anyone going out onto the fells. Goggles are highly recommended given the amount of fresh snow and spindrift being blown about. For those venturing above the snowline, an ice axe and crampons are essential. This is the case even on the so called “easy” routes owing to the amount of ice and hard snow (especially above 750m) making the going treacherous without the proper equipment even on relatively flat ground. The fell top assessor turned back today c100m before the summit owing to lack of visibility and the inability to clearly see the edges of steep drops; hence excellent navigational skills are required when deep snow obscuring landmarks is combined with low cloud especially when snow/spindrift is being blown about and obliterating your upward footprints – you can’t simply turn around and follow your footprints back down. There is the potential for walkers out on Thursday to encounter deep fresh snow, trudging through which saps energy; so please be conservative with your plans and know both your limits and also when to turn back.

The following report, though, will give you an idea of what ground any fresh snow will be covering. Ground conditions have changed little over the past 48 hours. Below 700m many paths were dry; however patches of ice were encountered at all levels especially on drainage lines or flatter ground where water had been able to thaw prior to freezing.

The largest accumulations of snow are to be found on E and N facing aspects. The snow was hard and occasionally icy. Any fresh snow falling on this old snow will not bond to it potentially creating an unstable layer and this must be considered for anyone attempting, or traversing, exposed ground above 700m on predominantly E or N facing slopes. Small cracks have appeared in some of the cornices that exist above N and E facing slopes, so please keep well clear of such edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise.

Here is today's report: A cold day in the hills with good visibility and light winds. Conditions have changed little overnight, and terrain was widely frozen down to low levels throughout the day. The snowline starts at roughly 700m and over the majority of ground above this height, it is a patchwork of snow, ice, and bare ground. Below 700m, the paths are largely clear of snow, although ice is present in places, particularly around any drainage lines. The greatest accumulations of snow are generally found on steep ground in high NE facing corries, gullies, and scarp slopes where long ribbons of snow still run unbroken right down to the corrie floor. All of the snow encountered today was hard névé (refrozen snow) and required the use of crampons to move over safely, even on relatively easy-angled terrain. Swirral and Striding edge both have steep banks of unavoidable hard snow on their exit slopes. The consequences of a slip or fall in these areas (or similar steep ground) could potentially be very long and damaging. Cold conditions look set to continue into next week, so it is advised that anyone venturing into the higher fells is adequately equipped. Full winter clothing (warm/waterproof layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots, as well as a map, compass and headtorch are all essential.

A pleasant change is that below 500m many paths, especially pitched ones, were dry!

For those venturing above the snowline and attempting, or traversing, exposed ground an ice axe and crampons are essential. Striding Edge was lulling people into a false sense of security today as its crest is mainly bare rock. Its exit, however, is guarded by a bank of steep, deep, unavoidable hard snow and ice.

The freezing level rose to just above summit level during the morning, and it was raining lightly across the tops just before midday. The milder temperatures meant that much of the snow encountered today was soft and heavy making walking quite arduous. Relatively light winds overnight and during the day means that wet snow has settled over much of Helvellyn's summit plateau. As a result, many of the paths have been covered over once again and in today's thick cloud, visibility was reduced significantly giving near whiteout conditions at times. At higher elevations, older patches of névé (refrozen snow) are still quite resistant to the thawing conditions and lie underneath the new snow in places.

The higher fells were extremely challenging today with near white-out, and occasional full white-out conditions making navigation very difficult. The wind speeds recorded today are less than was experienced on the way down and are estimated to have been around 40mph at times. Major paths were almost impossible to follow over large areas and footprints that were made on the way up were entirely filled in on the return journey.

Snow distribution is varied with the greatest accumulations on north through east-facing aspects where drifts up to 1 metre deep are not uncommon. South and west-facing slopes generally hold less snow, and high ground, exposed to the wind has been scoured exposing old hard refrozen snow (névé). New and drifted snow often lies over névé and ice, making even moderately angled ground serious to negotiate without microspikes or crampons.

We would like to remind everyone that Government guidance stipulates that people should only exercise locally, not leaving the village, town or city where they live. Yet again this week, today’s report comes with a health warning in that currently Cumbria is under another Met Office Yellow warning for both snow and ice from 4pm on Friday until 10-30am on Saturday. Therefore anyone exercising locally in the fells on Saturday should expect, and be prepared to encounter, more snow and ice (especially at lower elevations) than experienced and described in the following report. Below 500m, there is a slow daytime thaw of the snow that has fallen over the past 48 hours with the main snowline now being around 400m. However, this snow now being wet/thawed combined with an overnight valley frost tonight will create hard snow/ice below 500m on Saturday. Above 400m snow depth rises with altitude. It has been accompanied with strong predominantly W winds so the depth varies considerably from little on windswept areas (such as large parts of the summit plateau) to deep drifts of over one meter (although such depth is the exception) with 40-50cm drifts being relatively commonplace in sheltered spots and hollows and on predominantly SE to NE facing aspects. The fresh snow is soft powder and continues to be redistributed. Above 800m, again mainly on SE to NE facing aspects, the fresh snow can lie above neve (hard snow) with the 2 layers not bonding. This combined with windslab in the same areas has created unstable conditions which should be avoided. There are cornices above N and E facing slopes. Although they are small, they are also unstable so please keep well clear of such edges and advise those with less experience to do likewise. With a summit windchill around midday of minus 13 degrees C, full winter clothing (waterproofs, extra warm layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots and equipment are all essential for anyone going out onto the fells. Although the snowpack is currently mainly soft, for those venturing above the snowline an ice axe and crampons are essential. This is due to the older hard snow and ice that can be encountered and this is not limited to the more exposed routes, such as Striding and Swirral Edges. On the so called “easy” route up Helvellyn from Thirlmere there was a large area of unavoidable, steep, hard icy snow where a slip without the means to stop yourself quickly could have serious consequences. Owing to the amount of spindrift and hail being blown about, goggles are highly recommended. For thinner ice on paths, microspikes and poles are extremely useful. Trudging through soft snow saps the energy and, in addition, deep snow obscuring landmarks, combined with low cloud demands excellent navigational skills (especially near steep drops) so please be conservative with your plans for Saturday and know your limits. A pandemic is not the time to be pushing your comfort zone."

We would like to remind everyone that Government guidance stipulates that people should only exercise locally. Overnight snow settled down to 250m as Storm Christoph blew through. At higher elevations this was being rapidly redistributed onto mainly NE through SE aspects. This was being deposited as unstable soft wind slab in gullies, on steep slopes and in sheltered hollows up to a depth of 50cm. In a significant number of places this is overlying old icy snow which had survived the thaw of the last few days and has now refrozen hard, Additionally there were large volumes of grauphal being moved around in the wind. The combination of these factors mean that there are some very unstable areas of snow with a risk of avalanche. Unstable cornices were continuing to build above N through E to S slopes. Please give them a wide berth and advise others with less experience to do likewise. The Helvellyn plateau was generally frozen and scoured clear of snow. However there are some very large drifts to the lee of features and in hollows. The Swirls path is particularly badly affected with deep drifts to negotiate between 600-800m. There is also a large unavoidable patch of hard icy snow at Swirls Steep which requires an ice axe and crampons to safely cross. Swirral and Striding Edges are generally buried under drifts of deep snow overlying old refrozen neve with rime ice forming above 800m. Again an ice axe and crampons are essential for anyone tackling this or similar terrain. Full winter clothing (waterproofs, extra warm layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots and equipment are all essential for anyone going out onto the fells.

It should be noted that the police were questioning and possibly fining people who were returning back down off the hill today with cars registered from outside Cumbria. Gale to storm force winds were the main feature of today's weather making walking particularly arduous over any high and exposed ground. The snowline was down to Swirls car park this morning (roughly 200m), however, it was thawing at all levels up to 800m from where today's readings were taken. Snow depth increases a little with height and was typically around ankle-deep, although drifts up of up to one metre are not uncommon. Strong winds yesterday and today mean that snow distribution is now quite varied. Windward slopes (generally south through to west facing) have been quite well scoured and typically hold less snow than slopes in the lee of the wind (north through to east facing). Although not inspected today, cornices were seen building yesterday around many north and east-facing corrie rims, and in today's thawing conditions they will have been very unstable.

The snow level was around 300m and it remained sub-zero throughout the day from this altitude upwards. Snow depth increases with height and was typically around boot deep above 700m in areas where it wasn't affected by the wind. Drifts up to one metre deep are not uncommon. Older snow and ice also lies underneath the new snow, typically on high, steep ground in the north and east-facing corries. Almost all of the snow that fell yesterday is dry and unconsolidated making it very susceptible to wind transportation and this was happening at almost all levels on fresh to strong southwesterly winds. As a result, many slopes exposed to these winds were becoming scoured today and the snow was being redistributed on opposite north through east-facing slopes. Pockets of very unstable windslab have formed on many different aspects, typically along ridge flanks and around corrie rims where cornices are also building.

Depending upon your starting point, snow was falling and settling virtually down to valley level and certainly above 200m. At this altitude it was soft and wet with paths saturated so if there is an overnight valley frost tonight (currently not forecast, but only marginally so) walkers on Friday should expect to encounter ice on paths at all levels. With increasing altitude, the consistency of the snowpack changed to soft powder. The snow was being deposited on a predominantly easterly (SE-NE) strong breeze (5 to 6 on the Beaufort wind scale) with only 2cm on windblown areas to drifts of over 1m in sheltered spots and hollows. A very approximate average was around 10cm at 750m, with knee deep drifts being fairly common. This made the going hard and laborious and should be considered when route planning for Friday. Above 600m, and increasingly above 700m, the fresh snow lay above old snow and ice on paths and rocks making conditions treacherous especially on windblown areas with less snow cover.

A wintery day on the fells with slow moving snow showers and light winds. The terrain was generally frozen at all levels with only a slow thaw in the valleys throughout the day. The snow coverage across the National Park is very localised with levels being around 400m on Helvellyn while Penrith just down the road at 150m was looking rather snowy this evening. Yesterdays sun has also had an effect with the snow level on south facing slopes being much higher. The snow pack is currently very shallow including at summit levels and this combined with a lot of ice on paths meant that Microspikes were incredibly useful today almost from the car park. This ice hazard was most obvious between 300m and 600m. Above this altitude it was mostly hidden beneath the snow giving a false sense of security which can catch out the unwary. Snow showers on light winds throughout the day have added a thin layer to the existing cover. There has been very little redistribution by the wind although some soft deep drifts were found which slowed progress. Away from the paths the snow was still generally very soft and unconsolidated. Striding Edge is buried under a thin layer of soft but helpful snow and rime ice. The easiest route is along the exposed crest as the paths on the flanks are beginning to bank out. Swirral Edge felt far more serious today especially in descent with deeper and more unstable snow. The Helvellyn plateau has a good covering of snow and ice and navigation was tricky in the cloud as landmarks and paths have been obscured. There were small unstable cornices above the east face which should be given a wide berth. Crampons and an ice axe were essential today along with microspikes at lower elevations. Full winter clothing, hats & gloves, appropriate navigation equipment, a survival bag and a torch should also be carried. Please be conservative with your plans and know your limits."

The deepest drifts are to be found in sheltered spots and hollows and on S and W facing slopes. Above 900m are patches of old, hard snow. As many of these were on N and E facing slopes, little fresh snow (blown in on NE winds) has settled over them. Above 750m there were patches of ice on paths and the frequency of these increased with altitude. Exposed routes above the snowline, such as Striding and Swirral Edges, consist of soft snow, hard snow and some verglas (thin ice) on rocks. Given the current forecast, there is likely to be more ice underfoot on Thursday, so such routes should only be attempted by those equipped for, and experienced in, such conditions. Full winter clothing (waterproofs, extra warm layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots and equipment are all essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells. For those venturing above the snowline and attempting, or traversing, steep slopes an ice axe is essential and crampons should also be carried in case ice is encountered.

With snow in the forecast (potentially down to lower slopes) overnight and tomorrow morning, full winter clothing (waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots, and equipment are all essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells. Visibility tomorrow could be significantly reduced in any snow showers so a map and compass and good navigation skills may be required for safe travel. The freezing level tomorrow is also forecast to be around 400-500m so walkers should expect to encounter ice on the paths above this height."

It was a great day to be out on the fells today, although not if you like winter conditions as the snow has yet to arrive. The only sign of winter was in the form of isolated patches of thin ice on paths above 600m. Aside from this, many paths were dry with Striding Edge consisting of bare, dry rock. Despite the virtual lack of underfoot winter conditions, it was cold out with a summit temperature of zero and windchill of minus 7 degrees. Thus full winter clothing (waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves), mountain boots and equipment are all essential for anyone venturing out onto the fells. This is not just for safety, but also for enjoyment as the magnificent summit panorama today made it a place to linger and savour – which you certainly would not be able to do without a few extra warm layers!"
