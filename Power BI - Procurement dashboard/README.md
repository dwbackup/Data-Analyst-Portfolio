# Power Bi - Procurement dashboard

## Sample data - [Spend data.xlsx](Spend%20data.xlsx)
* Created fictitious company names using an online generator - [randommer.io](https://randommer.io/random-business-names)
* Created unique vendors, employees, department budgets, transactions (contracted and non-contracted).
* Used RANDNUMBER() function within Excel to create transaction amounts and transaction dates (e.g. RANDNUMBER(DATE(2022,1,1),DATE(2022,12,31))

## Import and data modeling
* Imported the spreadsheet into Power BI
* Within Power Query, check that the data types have imported correctly (date/numerical/text)
* Power BI recognized most of the relationships (primary keys to foreign)
* Reorganized the model to more easily recognize the relationships.
    * Two fact tables are the transaction tables for Contracted spend and OTV spend (One-time vendor, i.e. non-contracted spend).
    * The remaining tables are all dimension tables
